Dr. Seuss: American Icon,"Philip Nel takes a fascinating look into the key aspects of Seuss's career - his poetry, politics, art, marketing, and place in the popular imagination."" ""Nel argues convincingly that Dr. Seuss is one of the most influential poets in America. His nonsense verse, like that of Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear, has changed language itself, giving us new words like ""nerd."" And Seuss's famously loopy artistic style - what Nel terms an ""energetic cartoon surrealism"" - has been equally important, inspiring artists like filmmaker Tim Burton and illustrator Lane Smith. --from back cover",['Philip Nel'],A&C Black,2005-01-01,['Biography & Autobiography'],

Vector Quantization and Signal Compression (The Springer International Series in Engineering and Computer Science),"Herb Caen, a popular columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle, recently quoted a Voice of America press release as saying that it was reorganizing in order to ""eliminate duplication and redundancy. "" This quote both states a goal of data compression and illustrates its common need: the removal of duplication (or redundancy) can provide a more efficient representation of data and the quoted phrase is itself a candidate for such surgery. Not only can the number of words in the quote be reduced without losing informa tion, but the statement would actually be enhanced by such compression since it will no longer exemplify the wrong that the policy is supposed to correct. Here compression can streamline the phrase and minimize the em barassment while improving the English style. Compression in general is intended to provide efficient representations of data while preserving the essential information contained in the data. This book is devoted to the theory and practice of signal compression, i. e. , data compression applied to signals such as speech, audio, images, and video signals (excluding other data types such as financial data or general purpose computer data). The emphasis is on the conversion of analog waveforms into efficient digital representations and on the compression of digital information into the fewest possible bits. Both operations should yield the highest possible reconstruction fidelity subject to constraints on the bit rate and implementation complexity.","['Allen Gersho', 'Robert M.

"The Ultimate Guide to Law School Admission: Insider Secrets for Getting a ""Big Envelope"" with Your Acceptance to Law School!","This collection brings together a distinguished group of researchers to examine the power relations which are played out in university law schools as a result of the different pressures exerted upon them by a range of different 'stakeholders'. From students to governments, from lawyers to universities, a host of institutions and actors believe that law schools should take account of a vast number of (often conflicting) considerations when teaching their students, designing curricula, carrying out research and so on. How do law schools deal with these pressures? What should their response be to the 'stakeholders' who urge them to follow agendas emanating from outside the law school itself? To what extent should some of these agendas play a greater role in the thinking of law schools?",['Fiona Cownie'],Bloomsbury Publishing,2010-01-28,['Law'],

Portraits of the Presidents: The National Portrait Gallery,"A striking collection of presidential portraits from the National Portrait Gallery, this volume encapsulates the spirit of the most powerful office in the world. America's Presidents showcases the nation's largest collection of portraits of all the presidents beyond the White House's own, capturing the permanent exhibition that lies at the heart of the Portrait Gallery's mission to tell the American story through the individuals who have shaped it. The book explores presidential imagery through portraits ranging from the traditional, such as the iconic and newly restored ""Lansdowne"" portrait of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart, to the contemporary, such as Elaine de Kooning's colorful depiction of John F. Kennedy. Many of the featured portraits reveal much about the sitter, such as the intimate rendering of an informal George W. Bush by Robert Anderson and the fanciful, mosaic-like Chuck Close image of Bill Clinton. Some tell us more about the artist, such as the likeness of Franklin Delano Roosevelt that Douglas Chandor planned to include in a larger work about peace that would commemorate Roosevelt's Yalta meeting with wartime Allied leaders Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin. Works in other media, including sculptures and daguerreotypes, round out the presidential collection. Lively narratives accompany each piece, exploring the president's background and biography as well as the work's artistic and historical significance.

Josef Fuchs on Natural Law (Moral Traditions series),"Appointed by Pope John XXIII to the Pontifical Commission on Population, Family, and Birth, Fuchs ultimately found himself disappointed in his three years of service and spent the next thirty years exploring a broad array of issues pivotal to a reconstruction of Roman Catholic natural law theory. This is the first full-length analysis of Fuchs's efforts. Beginning historically by looking at Fuchs's writings and beliefs before the Pontifical Commission appointment, including his defense of natural law during the ""situation ethics"" debates of the 50s and 60s, the concept of personal salvation, and the status of ""nature"" and ""human nature,"" Graham moves to the intellectual conversion that inspired Fuchs to reconsider his concepts following the commission appointment. From there, Graham engages in a sustained critique of Fuchs's natural theory, addressing both the strengths and weaknesses to be found there and suggest possible avenues of development that would make a positive contribution to the ongoing quest to rehabilitate the Roman Catholic natural law theory that continues to dominate the landscape of moral theology today.",['Mark Graham'],Georgetown University Press,2002-10-25,['Religion'],

THE SECULAR CITY -SECULARIZATION AND URBANIZATION IN THEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE,"The study of Augustine's political teachings has suffered from a history of misreadings, both ancient and modern. It is only in recent years that the traditional lines of 'Augustinian pessimism' have been opened to question. Scholars have begun to explore the broader lines of Augustine's political thought in his letters and sermons, and thus have been able to place his classic text, The City of God, in its proper context. The essays in this volume take stock of these recent developments and revisit old assumptions about the significance of Augustine of Hippo for political thought. They do so from many different perspectives, examining the anthropological and theological underpinnings of Augustine's thought, his critique of politics, his development of his own political thought, and some of the later manifestations or uses of his thought in the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and today. This new vision is at once more bracing, more hopeful, and more diverse than earlier readings could have allowed.","['John Doody', 'Kim Paffenroth', 'Kevin L.

From Potter's Field,"The sixth book in the Kay Scarpetta series, from No. 1 bestselling author Patricia Cornwell. 'America's most chilling writer of crime fiction' The Times Christmas had never been a particularly good time for Dr Kay Scarpetta. Although a holiday for most, it always seem to heighten the alienation felt by society's violent fringe; and that usually means more work for Scarpetta, Virginia's Chief Medical Examiner. The body was naked, female and found propped against a fountain in a bleak area of New York's Central Park. Her apparent manner of death points to a modus operandi that is chillingly familiar: the gunshot wound to the head, the sections of skin excised from the body, the displayed corpse - all suggest that Temple Brooks Gault, Scarpetta's nemesis, is back at work. Calling on all her reserves of courage and skill, and the able assistance of colleagues Marino and Wesley, Scarpetta must track this most dangerous of killers in pursuit of survival as well as justice - heading inexorably to an electrifying climax amid the dark, menacing labyrinths of the New York subway.

Lincoln reconsidered;: Essays on the Civil War era,"A “brilliant” look at America’s sixteenth president by the New York Times–bestselling, Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Lincoln (American Historical Review). First published in 1956 and revised and updated for the twenty-first century, Lincoln Reconsidered is a masterpiece of Civil War scholarship. In a dozen eloquent, witty, and incisive essays, the author of the definitive biography of Abraham Lincoln offers a fresh perspective on topics previously shrouded in myth and hagiography and brings the president’s tough-mindedness, strategic acumen, and political flexibility into sharp focus. From Lincoln’s patchwork education to his contradictory interpretations of the Constitution and the legacy of the Founding Fathers, David Herbert Donald reveals the legal mind behind the legend of the Great Emancipator. “Toward a Reconsideration of the Abolitionists” sheds new light on the radicalism of the antislavery movement, while “Herndon and Mary Lincoln” brilliantly characterizes the complicated relationship between two of the president’s closest companions. “Getting Right with Lincoln” and “The Folklore Lincoln” draw on the methods of cultural anthropology to produce a provocative analysis of Lincoln as symbol. No historian has done more to enhance our understanding of Lincoln’s presidency and the causes and effects of the Civil War than Donald. Lincoln Reconsidered is an entertaining and accessible introduction to his work and a must-read for every student of American history.",['David Herbert Donald'],Open Road Media,2016-03-22,['History'],
Economics in one lesson,"With over a million copies sold, Economics in One Lesson is an essential guide to the basics of economic theory. A fundamental influence on modern libertarianism, Hazlitt defends capitalism and the free market from economic myths that persist to this day. Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication. Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy. Economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt’s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong — and strongly reasoned — anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.",['Henry Hazlitt'],Currency,2010-08-11,['Business & Economics'],18.0

However, the experiment was a disastrous failure. One of the reasons was the failure to stem extensive pogroms in Ukraine. In contrast to the traditional post-1927 view that has considered the Ukrainian government as the instigator of most of the pogroms, concludes that Petlyura was responsible, by default, for not doing enough to stop the hooligans, while Jewish political leaders bore some responsibility for failure to agree on Jewish self-defense.",['Henry Abramson'],Harvard Ukrainian,1999,['History'],
Islam and Mammon: The Economic Predicaments of Islamism,"The doctrine of ""Islamic economics"" entered debates over the social role of Islam in the mid-twentieth century. Since then it has pursued the goal of restructuring economies according to perceived Islamic teachings. Beyond its most visible practical achievement--the establishment of Islamic banks meant to avoid interest--it has promoted Islamic norms of economic behavior and founded redistribution systems modeled after early Islamic fiscal practices. In this bold and timely critique, Timur Kuran argues that the doctrine of Islamic economics is simplistic, incoherent, and largely irrelevant to present economic challenges. Observing that few Muslims take it seriously, he also finds that its practical applications have had no discernible effects on efficiency, growth, or poverty reduction. Why, then, has Islamic economics enjoyed any appeal at all? Kuran's answer is that the real purpose of Islamic economics has not been economic improvement but cultivation of a distinct Islamic identity to resist cultural globalization. The Islamic subeconomies that have sprung up across the Islamic world are commonly viewed as manifestations of Islamic economics. In reality, Kuran demonstrates, they emerged to meet the economic aspirations of socially marginalized groups. The Islamic enterprises that form these subeconomies provide advancement opportunities to the disadvantaged. By enhancing interpersonal trust, they also facilitate intragroup transactions. These findings raise the question of whether there exist links between Islam and economic performance. Exploring these links in relation to the long-unsettled question of why the Islamic world became underdeveloped, Kuran identifies several pertinent social mechanisms, some beneficial to economic development, others harmful.",['Timur Kuran'],Princeton University Press,2010-12-16,['Business & Economics'],

Compendium of Herbal Magick,"Every plant has its own distinct spiritual energy or its own deva. Devas are the radiant light of the Universal Divine that permeates all things. Since the earliest times, people were aware that all of Nature is divine. Great and wondrous myths were told that explained the presence of divine energy as it exists in thunder, in trees, and in sunlight. Some of this lore was the foundation of religions. But the simpler stories, such as those of a plant's energy, explored day-to-day matters like health and love. This understanding of the world has been preserved in folklore through poems, chants, ditties, and spells. From researching the history of folklore from cultures around the world, patterns emerge that enable us to approach the true nature of plants' devas. This compendium presents the lore and the corresponding usage for 330 magickal herbes. Great care was taken only to include folklore that was documented as authentic. You will meet many new herbes in this text and explore fascinating magickal and religi uses, but most of all, you will come to respect the divine that surrounds your everyday life.",['Paul Beyerl'],Phoenix Publishing (WA),1998,['Health & Fitness'],

Introduction To Mathematics for Life Scientists,"A few decades ago mathematics played a modest role in life sciences. Today, however, a great variety of mathematical methods is applied in biology and medicine. Practically every mathematical procedure that is useful in physics, chemistry, engineering, and economics has also found an important application in the life sciences.

However, the impact ofthe fast growing number of applications of mathematical methods makes it indispensable that students in the life sciences are offered a basic training in mathematics, both on the undergraduate and the graduate level. This book is primarily designed as a textbook for an introductory course. Life scientists may also use it as a reference to find mathematical methods suitable to their research problems.

Rodin in His Time: The Cantor Gifts to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art,"The sculpture of Auguste Rodin has become such an important part of our visual culture that it seems to have been with us always. The universal appeal of Rodin's work springs from its emotional expressiveness, its astonishingly lifelike vitality, and its passionate mirroring of the human condition. With his impressionistic technique, supported by a complete mastery of anatomical structure, Rodin overthrew the reigning academic precepts of finish and symmetry. By developing subjects beyond traditional allegories, he pointed the way to sheer abstraction in the twentieth century. This handsomely illustrated catalogue publishes for the first time in its entirety a major American collection of sculpture, the Cantor gifts to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and provides a rich context for Rodin's own work. It presents sculpture by Rodin's most important nineteenth-century forerunners--Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, François Rude, and others--as well as work by the contemporaries he admired, those with whom he competed, those he influenced, and those who moved from his orbit to develop their own styles at the dawn of the twentieth century. But the centerpiece of the book remains Rodin: forty-two works by the most influential sculptor of the modern period, all specially photographed and many shown in multiple views. -- Publisher description.","['Los Angeles County Museum of Art', 'Mary L.

Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish,"""I had an obsession with the Amish. Plan and simple. Objectively it made no sense. I, who worked hard at being special, fell in love with a people who valued being ordinary."" So begins Sue Bender's story, the captivating and inspiring true story of a harried urban Californian moved by the beauty of a display of quilts to seek out and live with the Amish. Discovering lives shaped by unfamiliar yet comforting ideas about time, work, and community, Bender is gently coaxed to consider, ""Is there another way to lead a good life?"" Her journey begins in a New York men's clothing store. There she is spellbound by the vibrant colors and stunning geometric simplicity of the Amish quilts ""spoke directly to me,"" writes Bender. Somehow, ""they went straight to my heart."" Heeding a persistent inner voice, Bender searches for Amish families willing to allow her to visit and share in there daily lives. Plain and Simple vividly recounts sojourns with two Amish families, visits during which Bender enters a world without television, telephone, electric light, or refrigerators; a world where clutter and hurry are replaced with inner quiet and calm ritual; a world where a sunny kitchen ""glows"" and ""no distinction was made between the sacred and the everyday."" In nine interrelated chapters--as simple and elegant as a classic nine-patch Amish quilt--Bender shares the quiet power she found reflected in lives of joyful simplicity, humanity, and clarity. The fast-paced, opinionated, often frazzled Bender returns home and reworks her ""crazy-quilt"" life, integrating the soul-soothing qualities she has observed in the Amish, and celebrating the patterns in the Amish, and celebrating the patterns formed by the distinctive ""patches"" of her own life.

"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","Thomas Paine was the impassioned democratic voice of the Age of Revolution, and this volume brings together his best-known works: Common Sense, The American Crisis, Rights of Man, The Age of Reason, along with a selection of letters, articles and pamphlets that emphasizes Paine's American years. “I know not whether any man in the world,” wrote John Adams in 1805, “has had more influence on its inhabitants or affairs for the last thirty years than Tom Paine.” The impassioned democratic voice of the Age of Revolution, Paine wrote for his mass audience with vigor, clarity, and “common sense.” This Library of America volume is the first major new edition of his work in 50 years, and the most comprehensive single-volume collection of his writings available. Paine came to America in 1774 at age 37 after a life of obscurity and failure in England. Within fourteen months he published Common Sense, the most influential pamphlet for the American Revolution, and began a career that would see him prosecuted in England, imprisoned and nearly executed in France, and hailed and reviled in the American nation he helped create. In Common Sense, Paine set forth an inspiring vision of an independent America as an asylum for freedom and an example of popular self-government in a world oppressed by despotism and hereditary privilege. The American Crisis, begun during “the times that try men’s souls” in 1776, is a masterpiece of popular pamphleteering in which Paine vividly reports current developments, taunts and ridicules British adversaries, and enjoins his readers to remember the immense stakes of their struggle. Among the many other items included in the volume are the combative “Forester” letters, written in a reply to a Tory critic of Common Sense, and several pieces concerning the French Revolution, including an incisive argument against executing Louis XVI. Rights of Man (1791–1792), written in response to Edmund Burke’s attacks on the French Revolution, is a bold vision of an egalitarian society founded on natural rights and unbound by tradition. Paine’s detailed proposal for government assistance to the poor inspired generations of subsequent radicals and reformers. The Age of Reason (1794–1795), Paine’s most controversial work, is an unrestrained assault on the authority of the Bible and a fervent defense of the benevolent God of deism. Included in this volume are a detailed chronology of Paine’s life, informative notes, an essay on the complex printing history of Paine’s work, and an index. LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation’s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America’s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.",['Thomas Paine'],Library of America,1995-03-01,['History'],8.0
Howard Zinn on History,"Howard Zinn began work on his first book for his friends at Seven Stories Press in 1996, a big volume collecting all his shorter writings organized by subject. The themes he chose reflected his lifelong concerns: war, history, law, class, means and ends, and race. Throughout his life Zinn had returned again and again to these subjects, continually probing and questioning yet rarely reversing his convictions or the vision that informed them. The result was The Zinn Reader. Five years later, starting with Howard Zinn on History, updated editions of sections of that mammoth tome were published in inexpensive stand-alone editions. This second edition of Howard Zinn on History brings together twenty-seven short writings on activism, electoral politics, the Holocaust, Marxism, the Iraq War, and the role of the historian, as well as portraits of Eugene Debs, John Reed, and Jack London, effectively showing how Zinn’s approach to history evolved over nearly half a century, and at the same time sharing his fundamental thinking that social movements—people getting together for peace and social justice—can change the course of history. That core belief never changed. Chosen by Zinn himself as the shorter writings on history he believed to have enduring value—originally appearing in newspapers like the Boston Globe or the New York Times; in magazines like Z, the New Left, the Progressive, or the Nation; or in his book Failure to Quit—these essays appear here as examples of the kind of passionate engagement he believed all historians, and indeed all citizens of whatever profession, need to have, standing in sharp contrast to the notion of ""objective"" or ""neutral"" history espoused by some. ""It is time that we scholars begin to earn our keep in this world,"" he writes in ""The Uses of Scholarship."" And in ""Freedom Schools,"" about his experiences teaching in Mississippi during the remarkable ""Freedom Summer"" of 1964, he adds: ""Education can, and should, be dangerous.""",['Howard Zinn'],Seven Stories Press,2011-06-14,['History'],
Goal,"Practical Goal Programming is intended to allow academics and practitioners to be able to build effective goal programming models, to detail the current state of the art, and to lay the foundation for its future development and continued application to new and varied fields. Suitable as both a text and reference, its nine chapters first provide a brief history, fundamental definitions, and underlying philosophies, and then detail the goal programming variants and define them algebraically. Chapter 3 details the step-by-step formulation of the basic goal programming model, and Chapter 4 explores more advanced modeling issues and highlights some recently proposed extensions. Chapter 5 then details the solution methodologies of goal programming, concentrating on computerized solution by the Excel Solver and LINGO packages for each of the three main variants, and includes a discussion of the viability of the use of specialized goal programming packages. Chapter 6 discusses the linkages between Pareto Efficiency and goal programming. Chapters 3 to 6 are supported by a set of ten exercises, and an Excel spreadsheet giving the basic solution of each example is available at an accompanying website. Chapter 7 details the current state of the art in terms of the integration of goal programming with other techniques, and the text concludes with two case studies which were chosen to demonstrate the application of goal programming in practice and to illustrate the principles developed in Chapters 1 to 7. Chapter 8 details an application in healthcare, and Chapter 9 describes applications in portfolio selection.","['Dylan Jones', 'Mehrdad Tamiz']",Springer Science & Business Media,2010-03-10,['Business & Economics'],

The Maxwell Leadership Bible Developing Leaders From The Word Of God,"The people, events, and teachings of the Bible are a treasury of wisdom and guidance for anyone who has been called to be a leader, to develop leaders, or to work with leaders-in church, business, commerce, or anyplace else. The Maxwell Leadership Bible shows us what God's Word has to say to people of all kinds about leaders and leadership.

Articles about the 21 Laws of Leadership in Scripture show us how these Laws are seen in the lives of Bible people. There are also articles about how the 21 Qualities of a Leader are shown in Scripture-in the cases of both those who got it right and those who got it wrong-and how people learned from their failures and became better leaders through God's redemptive process of education by experience.

"Pennant race,","From the author of The Long Season—considered by many to be the greatest baseball book of all time—comes another classic sports memoir by legendary pitcher Jim Brosnan, which chronicles how his team, the Cincinnati Reds, went on to win the 1961 National League pennant. With legendary pitcher Jim Brosnan’s first book, The Long Season, he not only entered the canon of great sports literature, but also redefined it when he returned two years later to write Pennant Race—his memoir of his days playing for the Cincinnati Reds and how the team went from not being taken seriously as a pennant contender to having a shot at the 1961 National League pennant. In Pennant Race, Brosnan—with his trademark wise-guy wit and plain-spoken practicality—once again offers a refreshingly candid alternative to hackneyed baseball mythologizing. Day by day, game by game, Brosnan reveals the real lives of professional ballplayers: their exhilaration and frustration, hope and despair, chronic worry over job security, playful camaraderie, world-weary cynicism, and boyish—if cautious—optimism. Although the Reds would ultimately lose the World Series to the Yankees, for Brosnan and his teammates, this was a winning season. Pennant Race vividly captures a remarkable year in the life of a ball club and the golden age of one of Major League Baseball’s most memorable eras. “Brosnan obviously knows his baseball, writes about it wittily, informally and with irony. He is a cynical, tough professional athlete and his book makes wonderful reading.”—New Yorker",['James P. Brosnan'],Harper Paperbacks,2017-07-04,['Sports & Recreation'],

They act as if they were afraid someone would recognize them. I am sure they aren't bad characters."" Captain Petersen, commander of the steamer ""Corsair,"" which for some days had been plowing its way through the ever-changing northern waters, stroked his grizzled beard reflectively. ""Bad characters, eh?"" he twinkled. ""Well, no, I shouldn't say as they were. They're fair-weather lads. I'll vouch for them if necessary, and I guess I'm about the only person on board that knows who they are."" Tad waited expectantly until the skipper came to the point of the story he was telling.

Pla/Cebo,"The placebo effect is a fascinating but elusive phenomena. Although no standard definition of the placebo effect exists, it is generally understood as consisting of responses of individuals to the psychosocial context of medical treatments or clinical encounters, as distinct from specific physiological effects of medical interventions. The Placebo is the first book to compile a selection of classic and contemporary published articles on the topic. Systematic investigation of the placebo effect emerged in the 1950s in response to the development of randomized controlled clinical trials that used “inert” placebo interventions as a pivotal element of scientific evaluation of novel drugs. In recent years, scientific and scholarly investigation of the placebo effect has increased dramatically, reflecting a growing interest in the connection between mind and body with respect to health, the development of brain imaging techniques, dissatisfaction with the reductionist and technological orientation of biomedicine, and growing attention to the use of complementary and alternative medical treatments. The Placebo is organized into three sections: the nature and significance of the placebo effect, experimental studies of the placebo effect, and ethical issues of placebos in research and in clinical practice. This comprehensive sourcebook will be invaluable to investigators and scholars alike.","['Franklin G. Miller', 'Luana Colloca', 'Ted J. Kaptchuk']",JHU Press,2013-08-14,['Medical'],

The Organic Codes: An Introduction to Semantic Biology,"The genetic code appeared on Earth with the first cells. The codes of cultural evolution arrived almost four billion years later. These are the only codes that are recognized by modern biology. In this book, however, Marcello Barbieri explains that there are many more organic codes in nature, and their appearance not only took place throughout the history of life but marked the major steps of that history. A code establishes a correspondence between two independent worlds , and the codemaker is a third party between those worlds . Therefore the cell can be thought of as a trinity of genotype, phenotype and ribotype. The ancestral ribotypes were the agents which gave rise to the first cells. The book goes on to explain how organic codes and organic memories can be used to shed new light on the problems encountered in cell signalling, epigenesis, embryonic development, and the evolution of language.",['Marcello Barbieri'],Cambridge University Press,2003,['Medical'],

"Women Creating Lives: Identities, Resilience, And Resistance","There is no other published book in English studying the constitution of the Roman Republic as a whole. Yet the Greek historian Polybius believed that the constitution was a fundamental cause of the exponential growth of Rome's empire. He regarded the Republic as unusual in two respects: first, because it functioned so well despite being a mix of monarchy, oligarchy and democracy; secondly, because the constitution was the product of natural evolution rather than the ideals of a lawgiver.Even if historians now seek more widely for the causes of Rome's rise to power, the importance and influence of her political institutions remains. The reasons for Rome's power are both complex, on account of the mix of elements, and flexible, inasmuch as they were not founded on written statutes but on unwritten traditions reinterpreted by successive generations. Knowledge of Rome's political institutions is essential both for ancient historians and for those who study the contribution of Rome to the republican tradition of political thought from the Middle Ages to the revolutions inspired by the Enlightenment.",['Abby J Stewart'],Westview Press,1994-06-15,['Social Science'],
Emotional Honesty & Self-Acceptance,"There is no excuse for not teaching preventive, healthy coping strategies to prepare kids for their teenage years. -- Ronald R. Brill In his innovative book, Emotional Honesty & Self-Acceptance, Ronald Brill, a former university professor and health educator, argues that youth can learn how to self-manage upsetting and stressful experiences. This work explains the relationship between recognizing and dealing with emotional pain, which is essential to avoid harmful behavior toward ones self and others. Since the book was published in 2000 he continues to research and develop training programs for educators, including advising schools and student services professionals so they can more effectively help students learn and practice brain-based coping skills to reduce thigh risk emotional stress. This book contains guiding principles used in classroom programs he introduced to over 700 4th to 6th grade elementary students from 2002 to 2008. His virtual classroom website, www.copingskills4kids.net, helps schools, parents and counselors guide children in the use of healthy and safe coping skills. The book and website are designed to enable recovery from everyday emotional pain caused by loss, rejection, betrayal and humiliation. He refers to these as universal, core Emotionally Wounding Experiences. Like physical wounds, emotional ones can also be infected if left unattended or ignored. His classroom programs prove that by age of nine, students can learn these lessons to begin preparing for the turbulent teenage years. Violence prevention is an important benefit of developing emotional resilience and self-acceptance. The authors commitment to brain-based coping skills learning is now shared by tens of thousands of individuals and institutions around the world seeking new ways to help youth avoid harming others for the emotionally wounds they may otherwise have not learned to heal. The 300-page book uses analysis of school shooting incidents to advocate new strategies schools and parents can use to boost kids coping confidence needed to more easily get over inevitable emotionally painful and stressful experiences. It is written for mature teenagers and adults. This powerful tool provides evidence to those advocating coping skills education programs at home and school. This approach with todays youth can make them more responsible and self-accepting persons. It also helps them develop new capabilities to deal with the emotional challenges and changes during adolescence. Some Introductory Chapter Titles: What We Dont Know About Hurt Feelings Can Kill Us!

Sweet Dream Baby,"Sent to live in the humidity of rural Florida with his grandparents and his sixteen-year-old Aunt Delia for the summer, twelve-year-old Travis becomes absorbed in the closed ways of small-town life. Captivated by Delia, Travis watches her attempt to find a place for herself in the socially stunted, gossip-driven town. Delia's secrets go beyond what Travis can understand, but he believes that he alone can save her--a belief that not only forces him to grow up fast, but one that builds to a dangerous and disturbing climax. In trying to free Delia from her past, Travis leads her into a shocking present and a most uncertain future. In a work at once honest, chilling and compulsively addictive, author Sterling Watson has created a time and place where rock 'n' roll hums from AM radios, steam rises from a secluded riverbed and violent summer storms threaten the peace of silent nights.

Enterprise Resources Planning and Beyond: Integrating Your Entire Organization (Resource Management),"To achieve success in today's business climate you must do more than provide high quality low cost products to customers when and how they want them. Customers and suppliers require fully integrated information - throughout the supply chain or value chain. You must integrate your organization so completely that executive decisions are implemented effortlessly. Competitive pressures often cause a reduction in prices, in spite of continually rising costs. A decrease in prices paired with increased costs quickly eliminates any profitability and threatens your company's ability to survive. This book shows you how you can reduce costs through the elimination of waste caused by poor communication and coordination throughout a company as well as between the company, its suppliers, and its customers. The author explains Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) in non-technical terms, describing how an ERP system can fully integrate all functions in your manufacturing organization. He demonstrates the system's capability to increase efficiency and profitability - and to delight the customer - as well as its current deficiencies. In addition to his thorough coverage of ERP, the author introduces Total Enterprise Integration (TEI), the process of integrating all the information required to fully support a manufacturing company. TEI represents a logical extension of complete information integration throughout a manufacturing enterprise and into the supply chain. This new concept shows you how the intelligent use of work flow allows responsibility to go to the most appropriate front-line decision makers while maintaining proper budgetary and operational controls. The power of TEI is in the integration of communication across the entire manufacturing company, and out through the supply chain to customers and suppliers. Enterprise Resource Planning and Beyond: Integrating Your Entire Organization focuses on what a fully integrated system can do for you.

The California Heritage Cookbook,"Food - its cultivation, preparation and communal consumption - has long been considered a form of cultural heritage. A dynamic, living product, food creates social bonds as it simultaneously marks off and maintains cultural difference. In bringing together anthropologists, historians and other scholars of food and heritage, this volume closely examines the ways in which the cultivation, preparation, and consumption of food is used to create identity claims of 'cultural heritage' on local, regional, national and international scales. Contributors explore a range of themes, including how food is used to mark insiders and outsiders within an ethnic group; how the same food's meanings change within a particular society based on class, gender or taste; and how traditions are 'invented' for the revitalization of a community during periods of cultural pressure. Featuring case studies from Europe, Asia and the Americas, this timely volume also addresses the complex processes of classifying, designating, and valorizing food as 'terroir,' 'slow food,' or as intangible cultural heritage through UNESCO. By effectively analyzing food and foodways through the perspectives of critical heritage studies, this collection productively brings two overlapping but frequently separate theoretical frameworks into conversation.","['Ronda L.

Advertising and a Democratic Press,"In this provocative book, C. Edwin Baker argues that print advertising seriously distorts the flow of news by creating a powerfully corrupting incentive: the more newspapers depend financially on advertising, the more they favor the interests of advertisers over those of readers. Advertising induces newspapers to compete for a maximum audience with blandly ""objective"" information, resulting in reduced differentiation among papers and the eventual collapse of competition among dailies.

The teachings contained in it were given to him by his Master in preparing him for Initiation, and were written down by him from memory - slowly and laboriously, for his English last year was far less fluent than it is now. The greater part is a reproduction of the Master's own words; that which is not such a verbal reproduction is the Master's thought clothed in His pupil's words. Two omitted sentences were supplied by the Master. In two other cases an omitted word has been added. Beyond this, it is entirely Alcyone's own, his first gift to the world. May it help others as the spoken teachings helped him - such is the hope with which he gives it. But the teaching can only be fruitful if it is lived, as he has lived it, since it fell from the Master's lips. If the example be followed as well as the precept, then for the reader, as for the writer, shall the great Portal swing open, and his feet be set on the Path.

Als een van de weinigen overleefde hij die hel en keerde hij terug en schreef, aanvankelijk uit een chaotische, blinde drang, Is dit een mens. In dit boek beschrijft hij in heldere taal en nuchter het leven in het kamp, de angst, de honger, de pijn, de ontberingen, de verschrikkingen. Het wordt terecht als een van de klassieke getuigenissen over de Jodenvervolging beschouwd. In de pers ‘Wat Primo Levi kon, was de afgrijselijkste en grootste misdaad in de moderne geschiedenis, de Holocaust, van binnenuit zo beschrijven, dat hij recht doet aan de complexiteit ervan.

The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft,"'a brilliant history' The Sunday Times 'makes for riveting reading' The Independent Modern pagan witchcraft is arguably the only fully-formed religion England has given the world, and has now spread across four continents. This second edition of The Triumph of the Moon extensively revises the first full-scale scholarly study of modern pagan witchcraft. Ronald Hutton examines the nature and development of this religion, and offers a history of attitudes to witchcraft, paganism and magic in British society since 1800. Its pages reveal village cunning folk, Victorian ritual magicians, classicists and archaeologists, leaders of woodcraft and scouting movements, Freemasons, and members of rural secret societies. We also find some of the leading figures of English literature, from the Romantic poets to W. B. Yeats, D. H. Lawrence and Robert Graves, as well as the main personalities who have represented pagan witchcraft to the public world since 1950. Thriller writers like Dennis Wheatley, and films and television programmes, get similar coverage, as does tabloid journalism. The material is by its nature often sensational, and care is taken throughout to distinguish fact from fantasy, in a manner not previously applied to most of the stories involved. Meticulously researched, The Triumph of the Moon presents an authoritative insight into an aspect of modern cultural history which has attracted sensational publicity but has hitherto been little understood. This edition incorporates new research carried out by the author as well as research by others who have been inspired by this book over the twenty years since its first publication.",['Ronald Hutton'],Oxford University Press,2019-10-10,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']",6.0

Steam: The Untold Story Of America's First Great Invention,"In 1807, Robert Fulton, using an English mail-order steam engine, chugged four miles an hour up the Hudson River, passing into popular folklore as the inventor of the steamboat. However, the true first passenger steamboat in America, and the world, was built from scratch, and plied the Delaware River in 1790, almost two decades earlier. Its inventor, John Fitch, never attained Fulton's riches, and was rewarded with ridicule and poverty. Considering there was not a single working steam engine in America in the early 1780s, Fitch's steamboat's development was nothing short of remarkable. But he faced competition from the start, and he and several other inventors fought a string of bitter battles, legal and otherwise. Steam tells the dramatic story of Fitch and his adversaries, weaving their lives into a fascinating tale including the likes of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin. It is the story behind America's first important venture in technology, the persevering and colorful men that made it happen, and the great invention that moved a new nation westward.",['Andrea Sutcliffe'],St. Martin's Press,2015-03-24,['History'],

"Labor's untold story,","""Fundamentally, labor's story is the story of the American people. To view it narrowly, to concentrate on the history of specific trade unions or on the careers of individuals and their rivalries, would be to miss the point that the great forces which have swept the American people into action have been the very forces that have also molded labor. Trade unionism was born as an effective national movement amid the great convulsion of the Civil War and the fight for black freedom... Labor suffered under depressions which spurred the whole American people into movement in the seventies, in the eighties, and in the nineties. It reached its greatest heights when it joined hands with farmers, small businessmen, and the black people in the epic Populist revolts of the 1890's and later in the triumph that was the New Deal. For labor has never lived in isolation or progressed without allies. Always it has been in the main stream of American life,... Labor's story, by its very nature, is synchronized at every turn with the growth and development of American monopoly. Its great leap forward into industrial unionism was an answering action to the development of trusts and great industrial empires. Labor's grievances, in fact the very conditions of its life, have been imposed by its great antagonist, that combination of industrial and financial power often known as Wall Street. The mind and actions of William H. Sylvis, the iron molder who founded the first effective national labor organization, can scarcely be understood without also an understanding of the genius and cunning of his contemporary, John D. Rockefeller, father of the modern trust. In the long view of history the machinations of J. P. Morgan, merging banking and industrial capital as he threw together ever larger combinations of corporate power controlled by fewer and fewer men, may have governed the course of American labor more than the plans of Samuel Gompers."" -- Amazon.com viewed January 11, 2021.","['Richard Boyer', 'Richard Owen Boyer', 'Herbert Montfort Morais']",United Electrical Radio &,1975,['Business & Economics'],2.0

Lanterns: A Memoir of Mentors,"I am grateful beyond words for the example of the lanterns shared in this memoir whose lives I hope will illuminate my children's, your children's, and the paths of countless others coming behind.--Marian Wright Edelman, from the Preface Marian Wright Edelman, ""the most influential children's advocate in the country"" (The Washington Post), shares stories from her life at the center of this century's most dramatic civil rights struggles. She pays tribute to the extraordinary personal mentors who helped light her way: Martin Luther King, Jr., Robert F. Kennedy, Fannie Lou Hamer, William Sloane Coffin, Ella Baker, Mae Bertha Carter, and many others. She celebrates the lives of the great Black women of Bennettsville, South Carolina-Miz Tee, Miz Lucy, Miz Kate-who along with her parents formed a formidable and loving network of community support for the young Marian Wright as a Black girl growing up in the segregated South. We follow the author to Spelman College in the late 1950s, when the school was a hotbed of civil rights activism, and where, through excerpts from her honest and passionate college journal, we witness a national leader in the making and meet the people who inspired and empowered her, including Dr. Benjamin E. Mays, Howard Zinn, and Charles E. Merrill, Jr. Lanterns takes us to Mississippi in the 1960s, where Edelman was the first and only Black woman lawyer. Her account of those years is a riveting first-hand addition to the literature of civil rights: ""The only person I recognized in the menacing crowd as I walked towards the front courthouse steps was [a] veteran New York Times reporter. He neither acknowledged me nor met my eyes. I knew then what it was like to be a poor Black person in Mississippi: alone."" And we follow Edelman as she leads Bobby Kennedy on his fateful trip to see Mississippi poverty and hunger for himself, a powerful personal experience for the young RFK that helped awaken a nation's conscience to child hunger and poverty. Lanterns is illustrated with thirty of the author's personal photographs and includes ""A Parent's Pledge"" and ""Twenty-five More Lessons for Life,"" an inspiration to all of us-parents, grandparents, teachers, religious and civic leaders-to guide, protect, and love our children every day so that they will become, in Marian Wright Edelman's moving vision, the healing agents for national transformation.",['Marian Wright Edelman'],Beacon Press,2013-05-01,['Biography & Autobiography'],

"The Devil in Silicon Valley: Northern California, Race, and Mexican Americans","This sweeping history explores the growing Latino presence in the United States over the past two hundred years. It also debunks common myths about Silicon Valley, one of the world's most influential but least-understood places. Far more than any label of the moment, the devil of racism has long been Silicon Valley's defining force, and Stephen Pitti argues that ethnic Mexicans--rather than computer programmers--should take center stage in any contemporary discussion of the ""new West."" Pitti weaves together the experiences of disparate residents--early Spanish-Mexican settlers, Gold Rush miners, farmworkers transplanted from Texas, Chicano movement activists, and late-twentieth-century musicians--to offer a broad reevaluation of the American West. Based on dozens of oral histories as well as unprecedented archival research, The Devil in Silicon Valley shows how San José, Santa Clara, and other northern California locales played a critical role in the ongoing development of Latino politics. This is a transnational history. In addition to considering the past efforts of immigrant and U.S.-born miners, fruit cannery workers, and janitors at high-tech firms--many of whom retained strong ties to Mexico--Pitti describes the work of such well-known Valley residents as César Chavez. He also chronicles the violent opposition ethnic Mexicans have faced in Santa Clara Valley. In the process, he reinterprets not only California history but the Latino political tradition and the story of American labor. This book follows California race relations from the Franciscan missions to the Gold Rush, from the New Almaden mine standoff to the Apple janitorial strike. As the first sustained account of Northern California's Mexican American history, it challenges conventional thinking and tells a fascinating story. Bringing the past to bear on the present, The Devil in Silicon Valley is counter-history at its best.",['Stephen J. Pitti'],Princeton University Press,2018-06-05,['History'],

"Compact Heat Exchangers: Selection, Design and Operation","This book presents the ideas and industrial concepts in compact heat exchanger technology that have been developed in the last 10 years or so. Historically, the development and application of compact heat exchangers and their surfaces has taken place in a piecemeal fashion in a number of rather unrelated areas, principally those of the automotive and prime mover, aerospace, cryogenic and refrigeration sectors. Much detailed technology, familiar in one sector, progressed only slowly over the boundary into another sector. This compartmentalisation was a feature both of the user industries themselves, and also of the supplier, or manufacturing industries. These barriers are now breaking down, with valuable cross-fertilisation taking place. One of the industrial sectors that is waking up to the challenges of compact heat exchangers is that broadly defined as the process sector. If there is a bias in the book, it is towards this sector. Here, in many cases, the technical challenges are severe, since high pressures and temperatures are often involved, and working fluids can be corrosive, reactive or toxic. The opportunities, however, are correspondingly high, since compacts can offer a combination of lower capital or installed cost, lower temperature differences (and hence running costs), and lower inventory. In some cases they give the opportunity for a radical re-think of the process design, by the introduction of process intensification (PI) concepts such as combining process elements in one unit. An example of this is reaction and heat exchange, which offers, among other advantages, significantly lower by-product production. To stimulate future research, the author includes coverage of hitherto neglected approaches, such as that of the Second Law (of Thermodynamics), pioneered by Bejan and co- workers. The justification for this is that there is increasing interest in life-cycle and sustainable approaches to industrial activity as a whole, often involving exergy (Second Law) analysis. Heat exchangers, being fundamental components of energy and process systems, are both savers and spenders of exergy, according to interpretation.",['John E.

Howard Zinn on War,"This second edition of Howard Zinn on War is a collection of twenty-six short writings chosen by the author to represent his thinking on a subject that concerned and fascinated him throughout his career. He reflects on the wars against Iraq, the war in Kosovo, the Vietnam War, World War II, and on the meaning of war generally in a world of nations that can't seem to stop destroying each other. These readings appeared first in magazines and newspapers including the Progressive and the Boston Globe, as well as in Zinn's books, Failure to Quit, Vietnam: The Logic of Withdrawal, The Politics of History, and Declarations of Independence. Here we see Zinn's perspective as a World War II veteran and peace activist who lived through the most devastating wars of the twentieth century and questioned every one of them with his combination of integrity and historical acumen. In his essay, ""Just and Unjust War,"" Zinn challenges us to fight for justice ""with struggle, but without war."" He writes in ""After the War"" (2006) that while governments bring us into war, ""their power is dependent on the obedience of the citizenry. When that is withdrawn, governments are helpless.""

Just Business: New Introductory Essays in Business Ethics,"faces the urgent problem of determining what political and social conditions must be preserved in order to ensure a continu. ing thriving economy. ""2 And the ethicist, we may add, can draw on all of those problems and quite a few more characteristic of situations when traditional communities struggle with the impact of sudden and unprecedented wealth as well as with a technological transformation of their society of singular proportions. Hong Kong is truly a society in transition, a society whose time is running short and which therefore cannot afford to wait long before it has to make decisive choices, choices also in ethics. The time factor which is so infamous in various ethical dilemmas applies here to the society as a whole; it may also account for some of its not just morally significant shortcomings. II. Ethics in a Cross-cultural Perspective The authors of this volume are scholars and researchers based in Hong 3 Kong who have been living and working in the territory for many years. They are not only representative of the increased research interest in ethical issues across the academic spectrum of Hong Kong universities, but also of the inter disciplinary approach which has become the hallmark of work in applied eth ics. As is well documented, ethics research, at long last, has left behind its disciplinary confines and, even more so, the philosophical ivory tower and begun to permeate the full scope of the academic and scientific agenda.",['Gerhold K.

The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton,"Interlacing humor into his ongoing narrative, Robert Allen Rutland provides in The Democrats a readable, balanced account of how the Democratic party was founded, evolved, nearly died, and came back in the twentieth century, flourishing as a political melting pot despite numerous setbacks.

In additon to analyzing Carter's successes and failures as president, Rutland also examines the forces that went into the Democratic defeats and Republican victories in 1980, 1984, and 1988, concluding with the election of another Jeffersonian Democrat, William Jefferson Clinton. The book ends with an examination of the dramatic results of the 1994 congressional elections that began to alert President Clinton to the challenge he would face in winning reelection in 1996.",['Robert Rutland'],University of Missouri Press,1995-10-01,['Political Science'],

Leopardi: A Study in Solitude,"An extremely moving account of the lonely life of the unloved and tragic genius - described as ""the greatest modern Italian poet"" 'Love me, by God; I need love, love, love, fire, enthusiasm, life. The world does not seem made for me' Giacomo Leopardi, considered the greatest Italian poet since Dante, was one of the most radical thinkers of the nineteenth century. He also regarded himself one of the most miserable and unfortunate people to have lived. Born to strict parents in a provincial town in 1798, he had a lonely childhood, and he spent his time largely in his father's library. He suffered from a debilitating illness, and his short life was full of pain. But this pain and misery gave rise to some of the most intense and brilliant poems ever written in the Italian language. In this poetic biography, Iris Origo, author of the bestselling War in Val d'Orcia traces the short and lonely life of this conflicted poet. Written with generosity and understanding, A Study in Solitude is a sharp, moving portrait of a frail and frustrated genius. Iris Origo (1902-1988) was a British-born biographer and writer. She lived in Italy and devoted much of her life to the improvement of the Tuscan estate at La Foce, which she purchased with her husband in the 1920s. During WWII, she sheltered refugee children and assisted many escaped Allied prisoners of war and partisans in defiance of Italy's fascist regime and Nazi occupation forces.

The Forsythe Saga,"The Forsyte Saga was the title originally destined for that part of it which is called The Man of Property; and to adopt it for the collected chronicles of the Forsyte family has indulged the Forsytean tenacity that is in all of us. The word Saga might be objected to on the ground that it connotes the heroic and that there is little heroism in these pages. But it is used with a suitable irony; and, after all, this long tale, though it may deal with folk in frock coats, furbelows, and a gilt-edged period, is not devoid of the essential heat of conflict. Discounting for the gigantic stature and blood-thirstiness of old days, as they have come down to us in fairy-tale and legend, the folk of the old Sagas were Forsytes, assuredly, in their possessive instincts, and as little proof against the inroads of beauty and passion as Swithin, Soames, or even Young Jolyon. And if heroic figures, in days that never were, seem to startle out from their surroundings in fashion unbecoming to a Forsyte of the Victorian era, we may be sure that tribal instinct was even then the prime force, and that family and the sense of home and property counted as they do to this day, for all the recent efforts to talk them out.",['John Galsworthy'],FilRougeViceversa,2021-08-27,['Fiction'],20.0

In Athena's Camp: Preparing for Conflict in the Information Age,"The information revolution--which is as much an organizational as a technological revolution--is transforming the nature of conflict across the spectrum: from open warfare, to terrorism, crime, and even radical social activism. The era of massed field armies is passing, because the new information and communications systems are increasing the lethality of quite small units that can call in deadly, precise missile fire almost anywhere, anytime. In social conflicts, the Internet and other media are greatly empowering individuals and small groups to influence the behavior of states. Whether in military or social conflicts, all protagonists will soon be developing new doctrines, strategies, and tactics for swarming their opponents--with weapons or words, as circumstances require. Preparing for conflict in such a world will require shifting to new forms of organization, particularly the versatile, hardy, all-channel network. This shift will prove difficult for states and professional militaries that remain bastions of hierarchy, bound to resist institutional redesign. They will make the shift as they realize that information and knowledge are becoming the key elements of power. This implies, among other things, that Mars, the old brute-force god of war, must give way to Athena, the well-armed goddess of wisdom. Accepting Athena as the patroness of this information age represents a first step not only for preparing for future conflicts, but also for preventing them.","['John Arquilla', 'David Ronfeldt']",Rand Corporation,1997-10-07,['Computers'],1.0

"Combined Operations: The Official Story of the Commandos, with a Foreword by Vice-Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten.","This is an astonishing, absolutely absorbing account of the accomplishments of those picked men from the Royal Navy, the British Army, and the Royal Air Force, who work with U.S. Rangers and others of the United Nations in what is known officially as Combined Operations—or, more popularly, the Commandos. So far as possible, without giving aid to the enemy, it is the complete story of the Commandos since the very beginning of their activities, commencing with the experimental attacks on Norwegian islands, and proceeding with more ambitious attempts on the Continent. In quick succession follow highly dramatic accounts of the assault on southern Italy, the evacuation of Crete, the defeat of the French in Syria, the daring penetration of the enemy’s line in Libya—culminating in the suspenseful stalking of Rommel’s headquarters—the assault on St. Nazaire, the capture of Madagascar, the Dieppe raid, the invasion of North Africa. The book is utterly without heroics, and yet is all heroism. The reader marvels at the terrible efficiency, the terrible simplicity, the terrible courage and the awesome nonchalance of the British Royal Navy and Army and R.A.F. men who participate in these raids. The author has the true narrator’s gift—a style which is direct, authentic, episodic in a high degree, and stirring from beginning to end.

Ambrose Bierce (1842-1914) was an American writer, journalist, critic, poet, and Civil War veteran, best known for The Devil's Dictionary (1911). He dominated the horror genre as the preeminent innovator of supernatural storytelling in the period between the death of Edgar Allan Poe and the rise of H.P. Lovecraft. Bierce’s death was as mysterious as his strange stories; sometime around 1914 he left for Mexico, wanting to experience the Mexican Revolution firsthand, and was never to be seen again.",['Ambrose Bierce'],Lindhardt og Ringhof,2022-06-21,['Fiction'],

Mayes is vooral bekend van haar idyllische boeken over het Toscaanse leven, zoals ‘Een huis in Toscane’ en ‘Bella Toscane’. In haar meeslepende debuutroman krijgt archeoloog Ginger Mason een telefoontje dat haar leven voorgoed verandert. Het lichaam van haar overleden moeder is om mysterieuze redenen opgegraven.

""Basically the finest essay I’ve ever read. . . . Baldwin refused to hold anyone’s hand. He was both direct and beautiful all at once. He did not seem to write to convince you. He wrote beyond you.” —Ta-Nehisi Coates At once a powerful evocation of James Baldwin's early life in Harlem and a disturbing examination of the consequences of racial injustice, the book is an intensely personal and provocative document from the iconic author of If Beale Street Could Talk and Go Tell It on the Mountain. It consists of two ""letters,"" written on the occasion of the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation, that exhort Americans, both black and white, to attack the terrible legacy of racism.

The Book of Love Laughter & Romance,"Rowdy, ecstatic, and sometimes stern, these teaching stories and fables reveal new and very human properties in Rumi's vision. Included here are the notorious “Latin parts” that Reynold Nicholson felt were too unseemly to appear in English in his 1920s translation. For Rumi, anything that human beings do—however compulsive—affords a glimpse into the inner life. Here are more than 40 fables or teaching stories that deal with love, laughter, death, betrayal, and the soul. The stories are exuberant, earthy, and bursting with vitality—much like a painting by Hieronymus Bosch or Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. The characters are guilty, lecherous, tricky, ribald, and finally possessors of opened souls. Barks writes: ""These teaching stories are a kind of scrimshaw—intricately carved, busy figures, confused and threatening, and weirdly funny. This is an entertaining collection from one of the greatest spiritual poets of all time, rendered by his most popular translator. “The minute I heard my first love story, I started looking for you, not knowing how blind that was.

Schooling As Violence,"The violent imagination begins in experiences of violation against the self and grows through the stories, myths, folktales and anecdotes of everyday life. Originally published in 1986, John Schostak discusses the educational, social and moral implications of the violent imagination in connection with theories of violence, childrearing practices, and schooling as a childrearing institution. He also looks at the relation between sexism, racism, drugs and the emergence of a vandalised sense of self. The book explores the complex ways in which images of violence pervade society, inform action and provide interpretations of events. Schools, the author argues, contribute towards the development of a violent imagination which guides judgements and actions. The child's images and experiences of violation may involve physical assault or psychological forms of assault. Some of these experiences of violation and violence are considered normal, even moral ('spare the rod and spoil the child'); others are considered abnormal, criminal, pathological - although the abstract logical form of each may be equivalent. Nevertheless, all such images contribute towards the development of a sense of violation, and children are schooled to accept normal forms and reject abnormal forms.","['John F Schostak', 'Taylor & Francis Group']",Routledge,2021-09,,

Seven Perennial Sins and Their Offspring,"Who was it who asked, ""Why does the devil have all the good tunes?""The seven ""deadly sins"" are not to be found in scripture as such, but they have been a staple of Christian preaching since the early church. Ken BazynÆs The Seven Perennial Sins and Their Offspring is more indebted to literature than to personal experience, ethics, or the contemporary obsession with psychology. Drawing upon a vast storehouse of reading from a wide variety of disciplines, Bazyn offers a ""thick description"" of each of these ""root"" sins, setting them in a broad temporal, cultural, and human context. The range of reference is enormous. We are as likely to encounter Madame Bovary as Evagrius Ponticus, Jay Gatsby as Blaise Pascal, Francois Truffaut as Francis of Assisi, testifying to the perennial nature of the temptation to pride or anger, gluttony or sloth. We succumb to them over and over partly, says the author quoting Jorge Luis Borges, because ""our minds are porous with forgetfulness."" With the widespread adoption of the Revised Common Lectionary, topical preaching--on the creed, the ten commandments, the beatitudes--has fallen out of use. Thus the even greater need for a book like The Seven Perennial Sins. Without ever moralizing, by means of anecdote and story, the book provides a serious, but often amusing, account of the dark side of the human comedy.",['Ken Bazyn'],Bloomsbury Academic,2002-10-23,['Religion'],

The Columbia Anthology of Modern Korean Poetry,"Korea's modern poetry is filled with many different voices and styles, subjects and views, moves and countermoves, yet it still remains relatively unknown outside of Korea itself. This is in part because the Korean language, a rich medium for poetry, has been ranked among the most difficult for English speakers to learn. The Columbia Anthology of Modern Korean Poetry is the only up-to-date representative gathering of Korean poetry from the twentieth century in English, far more generous in its selection and material than previous anthologies. It presents 228 poems by 34 modern Korean poets, including renowned poets such as So Chongju and Kim Chiha.",['David McCann'],Columbia University Press,2004-03-24,['Literary Criticism'],

"Cast, The","The story of the woman taken in adultery features a dramatic confrontation between Jesus and the Pharisees over whether the adulteress should be stoned as the law commands. In response, Jesus famously states, “Let him who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” To Cast the First Stone traces the history of this provocative story from its first appearance to its enduring presence today. Likely added to the Gospel of John in the third century, the passage is often held up by modern critics as an example of textual corruption by early Christian scribes and editors, yet a judgment of corruption obscures the warm embrace the story actually received. Jennifer Knust and Tommy Wasserman trace the story’s incorporation into Gospel books, liturgical practices, storytelling, and art, overturning the mistaken perception that it was either peripheral or suppressed, even in the Greek East. The authors also explore the story’s many different meanings. Taken as an illustration of the expansiveness of Christ’s mercy, the purported superiority of Christians over Jews, the necessity of penance, and more, this vivid episode has invited any number of creative receptions. This history reveals as much about the changing priorities of audiences, scribes, editors, and scholars as it does about an “original” text of John. To Cast the First Stone calls attention to significant shifts in Christian book cultures and the enduring impact of oral tradition on the preservation—and destabilization—of scripture.","['Jennifer Knust', 'Tommy Wasserman']",Princeton University Press,2020-01-14,['Bibles'],

"The Selected Prose of John Gray (British Authors Ser, 1880-1920)","Publication of Ian Fletcher's The Poems of John Gray (1988) was welcomed by reviewers in the U.S. and England. Now ELT Press offers a companion volume, The Selected Prose of John Gray. It complements the poetry by printing essays and short stories chosen from different periods of Gray's life--some selections previously unpublished, others having appeared only in limited periodical circulation. This new book adds to our understanding of Gray and topics relevant to the era. Professor McCormack explains the importance of the prose in her introduction: Gray has a significance for his time as a writer who has made the transition from the mannered decadence of ""The Modern Actor"" to the cryptic pre-modernist narrative of Park. As such, his work helps us reconstruct our own past: in particular, it requires us to acknowledge that abyss which lies between the late Victorian and the years after the Great War. As one who survived, not only personally but as a writer, Gray allows us to speculate on the strategies by which he sought to bridge that chasm. And in so doing, John Gray's work may provide an example of how on the edge of greater chasms, we may still presume to tell stories and to feel, in telling them, that they are permitted to tell us something about our experience--and ourselves. Professor McCormack traces the development of Gray's life and writings in her introductory essay. She prefaces each selection with a useful headnote. Her extensive notes to the prose clarify topical allusions and make Gray's work accessible to a wide audience.","['John Gray', 'Jerusha Hull McCormack']",Elt Press,1992,['Literary Criticism'],

Free Frank: A Black Pioneer on the Antebellum Frontier,"The story of Free Frank is not only a testament to human courage and resourcefulness but affords new insight into the American frontier. Born a slave in the South Carolina piedmont in 1777, Frank died a free man in 1854 in a town he had founded in western Illinois. His accomplishments, creditable for any frontiersman, were for a black man extraordinary. We first learn details of Frank's life when in 1795 his owner moved to Pulaski County, Kentucky. We know that he married Lucy, a slave on a neighboring farm, in 1799. Later he was allowed to hire out his time, and when his owner moved to Tennessee, Frank was left in charge of the Kentucky farm. During the War of 1812, he set up his own saltpeter works, an enterprise he maintained until he left Kentucky. In 1817 he purchased his wife's freedom for $800; two years later he bought his own liberty for the same price. Now free, he expanded his activities, purchasing land and dealing in livestock. With his wife and four of his children, Free Frank left Kentucky in 1830 to settle on a new frontier. In Pike County, Illinois, he purchased a farm and later, in 1836, platted and successfully promoted the town of New Philadelphia. The desire for freedom was an obvious spur to his commercial efforts. Through his lifetime of work he purchased the liberty of sixteen members of his family at a cost of nearly $14,000. Goods and services commanded a premium in the life of the frontier. Free Frank's career shows what an exceptional man, through working against great odds, could accomplish through industry, acumen, and aggressiveness. His story suggests a great deal about business activity and legal practices, as well as racial conditions, on the frontier. Juliet Walker has performed a task of historical detection in recreating the life of Free Frank from family traditions, limited personal papers, public documents, and secondary sources. In doing so, she has added a significant chapter to the history of African Americans.",['Juliet E.K. Walker'],University Press of Kentucky,2021-10-21,['History'],

Crusade of the Left: The Lincoln battalion in the Spanish Civil War,"Between 1936 and 1938, some 3,000 young Americans sailed to France and crossed the Pyrenees to take part in the brutal civil war raging in Spain. Virtually all joined the International Brigades, formed under the auspices of the Soviet-led Comintern and largely directed by Communists. Yet a large number were not Communists; their activism was inspired by domestic and international crises of the 1930s, and colored by idealism.The men who went to Spain came out of a radical subculture that emerged from the Depression and the New Deal. Th is radicalism was a native plant, but it was nourished from abroad. In the thirties the menace of fascism seemed to be spreading like cancer across Europe, giving an international aspect to many domestic problems in the United States. To intellectuals, students, unionists, liberals, and leftists, the threat of fascism was so real that many came to believe that if it was not stopped in Spain, eventually they would have to take up arms against fascism at home.To understand the Americans who fought in the Spanish Civil War it is necessary to bury some of the shibboleths of cold war years. Dissidence in the United States occurs in response to perceptions of reality on this side of the Atlantic, not because of the wishes of men in the Soviet Union. Th e members of the Lincoln Battalion were genuine products of America, and their story is properly a page in American military and political history. From them, one can learn much about the world of the 1930s and perhaps even something about the potential of modern man for thought and action in time of crisis.",['Robert Rosenstone'],Routledge,2018-02-06,['History'],
Language and Symbolic Power,"This volume brings together Pierre Bourdieu's highly original writings on language and on the relations among language, power, and politics. Bourdieu develops a forceful critique of traditional approaches to language, including the linguistic theories of Saussure and Chomsky and the theory of speech-acts elaborated by Austin and others. He argues that language should be viewed not only as a means of communication but also as a medium of power through which individuals pursue their own interests and display their practical competence. Drawing on the concepts that are part of his distinctive theoretical approach, Bourdieu maintains that linguistic utterances or expressions can be understood as the product of the relation between a ""linguistic market"" and a ""linguistic habitus."" When individuals use language in particular ways, they deploy their accumulated linguistic resources and implicitly adapt their words to the demands of the social field or market that is their audience. Hence every linguistic interaction, however personal or insignificant it may seem, bears the traces of the social structure that it both expresses and helps to reproduce. Bourdieu's account sheds fresh light on the ways in which linguistic usage varies according to considerations such as class and gender. It also opens up a new approach to the ways in which language is used in the domain of politics. For politics is, among other things, the arena in which words are deeds and the symbolic character of power is at stake. This volume, by one of the leading social thinkers in the world today, represents a major contribution to the study of language and power. It will be of interest to students throughout the social sciences and humanities, especially in sociology, politics, anthropology, linguistics, and literature.",['Pierre Bourdieu'],Harvard University Press,1991,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],3.0

Improving Governance: A New Logic for Empirical Research (American Governance and Public Policy series),"Policymakers and public managers around the world have become preoccupied with the question of how their goals can be achieved in a way that rebuilds public confidence in government. Yet because public policies and programs increasingly are being administered through a complicated web of jurisdictions, agencies, and public-private partnerships, evaluating their effectiveness is more difficult than in the past. Though social scientists possess insightful theories and powerful methods for conducting empirical research on governance and public management, their work is too often fragmented and irrelevant to the specific tasks faced by legislators, administrators, and managers. Proposing a framework for research based on the premise that any particular governance arrangement is embedded in a wider social, fiscal, and political context, Laurence E. Lynn Jr., Carolyn J. Heinrich, and Carolyn J. Hill argue that theory-based empirical research, when well conceived and executed, can be a primary source of fundamental, durable knowledge about governance and policy management. Focusing on complex human services such as public assistance, child protection, and public education, they construct an integrative, multilevel ""logic of governance,"" that can help researchers increase the sophistication, power, and relevance of their work.","['Laurence E.

"Lung Cancer: Making Sense of Diagnosis, Treatment, and Options","Lung cancer is the number one cancer killer in the U.S., with over 170,000 new cases diagnosed each year.

"Working Class Cultures in Britain, 1890-1960: Gender, Class and Ethnicity","Integrating a variety of historical approaches and methods, Joanna Bourke looks at the construction of class within the intimate contexts of the body, the home, the marketplace, the locality and the nation to assess how the subjective identity of the 'working class' in Britain has been maintained through seventy years of radical social, cultural and economic change. She argues that class identity is essentially a social and cultural rather than an institutional or political phenomenon and therefore cannot be understood without constant reference to gender and ethnicity. Each self contained chapter consists of an essay of historical analysis, introducing students to the ways historians use evidence to understand change, as well as useful chronologies, statistics and tables, suggested topics for discussion, and selective further reading.","['Prof Joanna Bourke', 'Joanna Bourke']",Routledge,2008-01-28,['History'],

The world is continuing to change at a rapid pace, while most organizations are focused on maintaining stability and certainty. The price of this growing gap is the diversion of limited resources to reactive, fire-fighting behaviors and the inability to lead and be proactive. Allowing the gap to continue to grow is the formula for failure, this book gives you the formula for success. In The EverChanging Organization, the authors present a model of the EverChanging Organization(ECO). This is a systems model for understanding an organization's needed capacity for change in a range of change orientations from change averse to change seeking.

Latin for Beginners (Language Guides),"Earn-lay atin-Lay? No, not that kind of Latin! You can learn true Latin, with conjugations, declensions, and all those extra syllables – and it’s easier than you think. In fact, most people mistakenly think of learning Latin as perhaps the most useless, tedious, and difficult thing to do on earth. They couldn’t be more wrong. Latin For Dummies takes you back for a quick jaunt through the parlance of ancient Rome, as well as discussing the progress of Latin into church language, and its status today as the “dead” language that lives on in English, Spanish, Italian, and most other Western tongues. Written for those with zero prior knowledge of Latin, this snappy guide puts the basics at your fingertips and steers clear of the arcane, schoolmarm stereotype of endless declensions and Herculean translations.

And if you feel you may actually have a negative aptitude for the language, don’t worry; pronunciations and translations follow every expression, and a helpful mini-dictionary graces the book’s last pages. You’ll also find out about: The quotable Roman Latin graffiti Latin authors who’s who Gladiator Latin Latin in love, marriage, and family From the mouth of Julius Caesar Romans on drink Helpful Latin-related Web sites Fun and games exercises Designed to introduce and familiarize you with the language rather than make you the next Cicero, Latin For Dummies gives you all the tools you need to work at your own pace to learn as much or as little as you like.

The Man Who Talks to Dogs: The Story of America's Wild Street Dogs and Their Unlikely Savior,"Go to any unpopulated or abandoned area in any given urban setting, and you'll find them. Thousands and thousands of wild dogs-abandoned to disease, starvation, and inevitable death-are leading short and brutal lives in the no-man's-land between domestication and wildness, byproducts of the human destitution around them. A lucky few are saved by dedicated rescuers, and Randy Grim, has emerged as one of the country's leading dog saviors. After years of rescuing dogs on his own, he founded Stray Rescue of St. Louis, an organization dedicated to rescue and rehabilitation. These are dogs that belong to no one, the ones animal-control experts can't catch and humane shelters won't deal with. They are stray or feral, either abandoned or born wild on the streets, which means they won't come near humans and statistically won't live past their second year. And their numbers are growing every day. In The Man Who Talks to Dogs, journalist Melinda Roth narrates Grim's dramatic, inspiring efforts and tells the horrific and heartwarming stories of the dogs he saves, showing how this growing national health problem-controlled by no federal or local regulations-can no longer be ignored.",['Melinda Roth'],Thomas Dunne Books,2002-12-06,['Pets'],

Change and Continuity in Spatial Planning,"Change and Continuity in Spatial Planning addresses a question of enduring interest to planners: can planning really bring about significant and positive change? In South Africa the process of political transition appeared to create the preconditions for planners to demonstrate how their traditional humanitarian and environmental concerns could find concrete expression in the reshaping of the built environment. Integral to this story is how planning practices have been shaped by the past, in a rapidly changing context characterised by a globalising economy, new systems of governance, a changing political ideology, and a culture of intensifying poverty and diversity. More broadly, the book addresses the issue of how planners use power, in situations which themselves represent networks of power relations, where both planners and those they engage with operate through frames of reference fundamentally shaped by place and history.",['Vanessa Watson'],Routledge,2003-12-16,['Architecture'],

The Pro: Lessons from My Father About Golf and Life,"Butch Harmon is the world’s number one golf coach. He taught Tiger Woods through one of the greatest stretches of victories in golf history (and, perhaps even more conspicuously, did not teach Tiger Woods following his unprecedented run), as well as superstars like Greg Norman, Adam Scott, Fred Couples, Darren Clarke, Natalie Gulbis, and Davis Love III. How did he become such a legendary teacher and mentor? The answer is simple: He learned from watching his father. The Harmons are the First Family of golf, and Claude Harmon, Sr., was the greatest of them all. His skill as a player, an innovator, a teacher, a devoted father, a loyal friend, and a peer of giants such as Ben Hogan has gone largely unappreciated by all but those who knew him best. In this book by his son, he finally gets his due. In The Pro, Butch Harmon paints a compelling portrait of an era in sports before the emergence of big media and bigger money, and shows how the lessons he learned about life and golf at his father’s knee made him the man he is today. The Pro is both a family and a golf memoir, as well as an inside look at what it takes to teach the Tigers of the world. It describes how Butch and his brothers, who are also teachers, transfer their father’s unique wit, wisdom, and philosophy to the next generation of golfers. Sometimes their advice relates to the game, sometimes they simply offer words of encouragement and motivation, sometimes they make pointed criticisms intended to shock their students into focus, and sometimes they try to impart simple advice about “walking around through life.” The Harmon brothers are teachers who share a special quality: All of their lessons are passed down from their father. Millions of golf fans know Butch Harmon; many are even familiar with his father and brothers. But never before have we been given such an intimate look at life among the legends of golf. The Pro is the story of an extraordinary father and son that will resonate with anyone who has ever looked back on life and recognized the wisdom of their parents’ teachings. ""Golf's hard,"" Dad would say, pointing a meaty finger at me as if he were about to reveal the secret of the Rosetta Stone. “Good golf is damn hard, and championship golf is something only a few will ever see. But that’s how it should be. If it were easy, everybody would do it. And where’s the fun in that?” From Butch Harmon, the world’s number one golf coach, comes the inside story of how he learned everything he knows about golf and life from his father, Claude Harmon, Sr. Both a family memoir and a reminiscence of growing up among the legends of sport, The Pro is a portrait of one extraordinary family and the game that will carry their legacy for years to come.",['Butch Harmon'],Crown,2006-05-09,['Sports & Recreation'],

Wallace Stevens: A Poet's Growth,"In Wallace Stevens: A Poet’s Growth, George S. Lensing examines Stevens’ gradual emergence and development as a poet, tracing his life from his formative years in Pennsylvania to his careers as a lawyer for the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company and as one of the major poets of the twentieth century. Lensing draws extensively upon previously unpublished material from the Stevens archive at the Huntington Library, which contains letters, early drafts of poems, and notebooks. Two notebooks,Schemata and From Pieces of Paper, are here reproduced in full. The study is divided into three sections. In the first, Lensing examines the years before the publication of Sevens’ first volume of poetry, paying special attention to the forces that hindered and enhanced his progress toward modernity. In the second, we see Stevens in the exercise of his craft. Lensing discusses the influence of the Romantics on the verse Stevens wrote as an undergraduate at Harvard; his interest in Oriental art, Cubism, and Fauvism; his anticipation of Imagism; and his imitation of certain French Symbolists. Sources of the epigraphs to Stevens’ poems are identified fully for the first time, suggesting the role of Stevens’ vast reading upon his poetry. Also considered is Stevens’ voluminous correspondence with people from all over the world, some of whom he never met personally. These letters helped rescue Stevens from the insularity of his business life and aided in the making of his poems. The final section treats the critical responses to Stevens’ poetry by such people as Harriet Monroe, editor and founder of Poetry, who was the first important reader and publisher of his work. Attention is also given to Stevens’ explications of his poems. Wallace Stevens: A Poet’s Growth is a comprehensive examination of Stevens’ live and work. This study provides abundant new material, which will be of value to scholars and to those readers who are drawn to Stevens’ poetry.",['George S. Lensing'],LSU Press,1986-12,['Literary Criticism'],
Dick Bong: Ace of Aces,"Major Richard “Dick” Ira Bong died at the tender age of 24 on the 6th August 1945 in a flight accident during testing of the P-80 Shooting Star Fighter. His fame was such that news of his death vied with the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima in the US press, his legendary exploits at the helm of his P-38 Lightning had made him a household name. Bong had only recently received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his exploits of downing 40 enemy Japanese planes in the Southwestern Pacific. His tally of 40 victories made him the highest scoring American ace of all time, a record that is unlikely to ever be broken. In this biography his former commanding officer General George C. Kenney recounts his life; from his early life in Wisconsin, his sweetheart Marge, and his aerial exploits.

Romola; (Her Works),"The figure of Dante's Beatrice can be seen as a cultural phenomenon or myth during the nineteenth century, inspiring a wide variety of representations in literature and the visual arts. This study looks at the cultural afterlife of Beatrice in the Victorian period in remarkably different contexts. Focusing on literary representations and selected examples from the visual arts, this book examines works by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Christina Rossetti, George Eliot, Alfred Lord Tennyson and Walter Pater as well as by John Ruskin, Maria Rossetti and Arthur Henry Hallam. Julia Straub's analysis shows how the various representations of Beatrice in literature and in the visual arts reflect in meaningful ways some of the central social and aesthetic concerns of the Victorian period, most importantly its discourse on gender. This study offers fascinating insights into the Victorian reception of Dante by exploring the powerful appeal of his muse.",['Julia Straub'],Bloomsbury Publishing,2011-11-03,['Literary Criticism'],

Your Signature Work: Creating Excellence and Influencing Others at Work,"Are you bored in your job? Has the newness worn off so much so that you dread going to work every day? Have you ever felt as if your tasks––whether in a big organization or at home––just didn’t really contribute to anything significant? Do you often speculate about how much more influence you could have if you worked in a more visible or critical role––like may be a doctor, a pastor, a congressional representative? If so, then this book will inspire you to take a more reflective look at where you work, how you work, and who you influence. You’ll explore challenges such as these: · Finding the right job · Finding your calling in life · How to find purpose in life · Doing your best at work and what that looks like practically speaking As a companion to the earlier book Your Signature Life by the same author, Your Signature Work expands on the concept of doing your personal best at work so that it reflects your goals, values, beliefs, and faith. Using a sports analogy (basketball), this companion book will challenge you to see your tasks and job—whether parenting, building a forklift, stocking shelves, selling pharmaceuticals, or analyzing computer glitches––as an opportunity for leadership and service to others. As you strive for personal excellence, you'll identify ways to influence others in your workplace to “live” their values and faith. Even if you feel trapped in a dissatisfying job or a seemingly insignificant career, your work matters to God and to others in need. Your attitude can make all the difference in how you view your job, and the results you achieve! When you find your true calling, your work will be a source of satisfaction and fulfillment. And as an artist does, you will be proud to sign your name to work! Author and speaker Dianna Booher shares the same in-depth insights that she offers to churches and her Fortune 500 clients during keynotes and workshops. As founder and CEO of Booher Research, she’s an internationally recognized leadership communication and executive presence expert.

THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE,"Stephen King, Over leven en schrijven `Een meesterverteller.' VPRO Gids `Hoe doet King dat toch?' vroeg Joost Zwagerman zich al af in de Volkskrant. Hoe slaagt King er toch telkens weer in zijn lezers aan zich te binden en ze te verrassen? Hierover gaat Over leven en schrijven. Stephen King verhaalt over zijn jeugd, zijn puberjaren en zijn studietijd. Over de jaren na zijn doorbraak als schrijver, met Carrie, waarin succes en stress hem achtervolgen en de drank een uitvlucht biedt. Over het ongeluk dat hem in 1999 bijna het leven kost. En hoe hij er weer bovenop komt door zijn onweerstaanbare drang tot schrijven. Over wat hem inspireert en hoe hij te werk gaat. En natuurlijk laat King zijn licht schijnen over het belangrijkste wapen van elke schrijver: de pen die de auteur altijd in de aanslag moet hebben. Over leven en schrijven is een bron van inspiratie, voor zowel lezers als (aspirant-)schrijvers. Stephen King (1947) heeft meer dan tweehonderd verhalen op zijn naam staan, waaronder vijftig thriller- en fantasy-titels, alle wereldwijde bestsellers, waaronder Under the Dome (Gevangen), 22-11-1963, De Donkere Toren-reeks, Joyland,De Shining en Dr. Sleep.",['Stephen King'],Luitingh Sijthoff,2013-10-31,['Biography & Autobiography'],

"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","In this brilliant look at the rise of political Islam, the distinguished political scientist and anthropologist Mahmood Mamdani brings his expertise and insight to bear on a question many Americans have been asking since 9/11: how did this happen? Mamdani dispels the idea of “good” (secular, westernized) and “bad” (premodern, fanatical) Muslims, pointing out that these judgments refer to political rather than cultural or religious identities. The presumption that there are “good” Muslims readily available to be split off from “bad” Muslims masks a failure to make a political analysis of our times. This book argues that political Islam emerged as the result of a modern encounter with Western power, and that the terrorist movement at the center of Islamist politics is an even more recent phenomenon, one that followed America’s embrace of proxy war after its defeat in Vietnam. Mamdani writes with great insight about the Reagan years, showing America’s embrace of the highly ideological politics of “good” against “evil.” Identifying militant nationalist governments as Soviet proxies in countries such as Nicaragua and Afghanistan, the Reagan administration readily backed terrorist movements, hailing them as the “moral equivalents” of America’s Founding Fathers. The era of proxy wars has come to an end with the invasion of Iraq. And there, as in Vietnam, America will need to recognize that it is not fighting terrorism but nationalism, a battle that cannot be won by occupation. Good Muslim, Bad Muslim is a provocative and important book that will profoundly change our understanding both of Islamist politics and the way America is perceived in the world today.",['Mahmood Mamdani'],Harmony,2005-06-21,['Religion'],4.0
Pushing Ice,"First contact with extraordinary aliens, glittering technologies that could destroy the universe in a nanosecond, huge sweeping space operas: Alastair Reynolds is back! Some centuries from now, the exploration and exploitation of the Solar System is in full swing. On the cold edge of the system, Bella Lind, captain of the huge commercial spacecraft Rockhopper IV, helps fuel this new gold rush by attaching mass-driver motors to organic-rich water-ice comets to move them back to the inner worlds. Her crew are tough, blue-collar miners, engineers and demolition experts. Around Saturn, something inexplicable happens: one of the moons leaves its orbit and accelerates out of the Solar System. The icy mantle peels away to reveal that it was never a moon in the first place, just a parked spacecraft, millions of years old, that has now decided to move on. Rockhopper IV, trapped in the pull, is hurled across time and space into the deep, distant future, arriving in a vast, alien-constructed chamber. And the crew are not alone, for each chamber contains an alien culture dragged into this cosmic menagerie at the end of time. The crew of the Rockhopper IV know a lot about blowing up comets, but not much about first contact with ultra-advanced aliens. They have two things to worry about: can they (and their new alien allies) negotiate their way through each harrying contact? And can they assimilate the avalanche of knowledge about their own future - including all the glittering, dangerous technologies that are now theirs for the taking - without destroying themselves in the process?",['Alastair Reynolds'],Hachette UK,2009-12-10,['Fiction'],29.0

The Case That Never Dies: The Lindbergh Kidnapping,"Essential reading for anyone interested in the most famous American crime of the twentieth century Since its original publication in 2004, The Case That Never Dies has become the standard account of the Lindbergh Kidnapping. Now, in a new afterword, historian Lloyd C. Gardner presents a surprise conclusion based on recently uncovered pieces of evidence that were missing from the initial investigation as well as an evaluation of Charles Lindbergh’s role in the search for the kidnappers. Out of the controversies surrounding the actions of Colonel Lindbergh, Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of the New Jersey State Police, and FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, Gardner presents a well-reasoned argument for what happened on the night of March 1, 1932. The Case That NeverDies places the Lindbergh kidnapping, investigation, and trial in the context of the Depression, when many feared the country was on the edge of anarchy. Gardner delves deeply into the aspects of the case that remain confusing to this day, including Lindbergh’s dealings with crime baron Owney Madden, Al Capone’s New York counterpart, as well as the inexplicable exploits of John Condon, a retired schoolteacher who became the prosecution’s best witness. The initial investigation was hampered by Colonel Lindbergh, who insisted that the police not attempt to find the perpetrator because he feared the investigation would endanger his son’s life. He relented only when the child was found dead. After two years of fruitless searching, Bruno Richard Hauptmann, a German immigrant, was discovered to have some of the ransom money in his possession. Hauptmann was arrested, tried, and sentenced to death. Throughout the book, Gardner pays special attention to the evidence of the case and how it was used and misused in the trial. Whether Hauptmann was guilty or not, Gardner concludes that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of first-degree murder. Set in historical context, the book offers not only a compelling read, but a powerful vantage point from which to observe the United States in the 1930s as well as contemporary arguments over capital punishment.",['Lloyd Gardner'],Rutgers University Press,2012-06-12,['History'],

Wal-Mart: The Face of Twenty-First-Century Capitalism,"A collection of essays that “do an incredible job of balancing the wonders and horrors of the force that is Wal-Mart” (Booklist, starred review). Edited by one of the nation’s preeminent labor historians, this book marks an ambitious effort to dissect the full extent of Wal-Mart’s business operations, its social effects, and its role in the United States and world economy. Wal-Mart is based on a spring 2004 conference of leading historians, business analysts, sociologists, and labor leaders that immediately attracted the attention of the national media, drawing profiles in the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and the New York Review of Books. Their contributions are adapted here for a general audience. At the end of the nineteenth century, the Pennsylvania Railroad declared itself “the standard of the world.” In more recent years, IBM and then Microsoft seemed the template for a new, global information economy. But at the dawn of the twenty-first century, Wal-Mart had overtaken all rivals as the world-transforming economic institution of our time. Presented in an accessible format and extensively illustrated with charts and graphs, Wal-Mart examines such topics as the giant retailer’s managerial culture, revolutionary use of technological innovation, and controversial pay and promotional practices to provide the most complete guide yet available to one of America’s largest companies. “Like archaeologists who pick over artifacts to understand an ancient society, the scholars here [are] examining Wal-Mart for insights into the very nature of American capitalist culture.” —The New York Times “Stimulating perspectives on the world’s largest corporation.” —Publishers Weekly",['Nelson Lichtenstein'],The New Press,2016-02-02,['Business & Economics'],

The murderers have been hired, and the Damascus authorities have agreed to look the other way, put in another breathlessly. For a moment there was silence from Saul. Well, what are you going to do? Whispered the visitors fearfully. Saul thought joyfully of how Saint Stephen had been martyred for Christ. But he knew that was not Gods will for him just yet. Ill leave Damascus and escape to Jerusalem, he answered. Ill go after dark. Will you help me? But the watchmen will never let you pass the city gates. Theyve all been bribed by you enemies. Well bypass the city gates, answered Saul calmly. Just let me explain. What did Saul have in mind? Would it be dangerous? And would it work? This book tells what happened. It also describes how Paul won victories over the Devil, how he was mistaken for a god, and how he faced court trials, scourging, imprisonment, angry mobs and, finally, martyrdom for Christ.

King Rat,"Japanese POW camp Changi, Singapore: hell on earth for the soldiers contained within its barbed wire walls. Officers and enlisted men, all prisoners together, yet the old hierarchies and rivalries survive. An American corporal, known as the King, has used his personality and wiles to facilitate trading with guards and locals to get needed food, supplies, even information into the camp. The imprisoned upper-class officers have never had to do things for themselves, and now they are reduced to wearing rags while the King’s clean shirt, gained through guts and moxie, seems like luxury in comparison. In the camp, everything has its price and everything is for sale. But trading is illegal—and the King has made a formidable enemy. Robin Grey, the provost marshal, hates the King and all he represents. Grey, though he grew up modestly, fervently believes in the British class system: everyone should know their place, and he knows the King’s place is at the bottom. The King does have a friend in Peter Marlowe, who, though wary of the King and himself a product of the British system, finds himself drawn to the charismatic man who just might be the only one who can save them from both the inhumanity of the prison camp but also from themselves. Powerful and engrossing, King Rat artfully weaves the author’s own World War II prison camp experiences into a compelling narrative of survival amidst the grim realities of war and what men can do when pushed to the edge.

What Would Jefferson Say?,"PREFACE. THE Author of this very practical treatise on Scotch Loch - Fishing desires clearly that it may be of use to all who had it. He does not pretend to have written anything new, but to have attempted to put what he has to say in as readable a form as possible. Everything in the way of the history and habits of fish has been studiously avoided, and technicalities have been used as sparingly as possible. The writing of this book has afforded him pleasure in his leisure moments, and that pleasure would be much increased if he knew that the perusal of it would create any bond of sympathy between himself and the angling community in general. This section is interleaved with blank shects for the readers notes. The Author need hardly say that any suggestions addressed to the case of the publishers, will meet with consideration in a future edition. We do not pretend to write or enlarge upon a new subject. Much has been said and written-and well said and written too on the art of fishing but loch-fishing has been rather looked upon as a second-rate performance, and to dispel this idea is one of the objects for which this present treatise has been written. Far be it from us to say anything against fishing, lawfully practised in any form but many pent up in our large towns will bear us out when me say that, on the whole, a days loch-fishing is the most convenient. One great matter is, that the loch-fisher is depend- ent on nothing but enough wind to curl the water, -and on a large loch it is very seldom that a dead calm prevails all day, -and can make his arrangements for a day, weeks beforehand whereas the stream- fisher is dependent for a good take on the state of the water and however pleasant and easy it may be for one living near the banks of a good trout stream or river, it is quite another matter to arrange for a days river-fishing, if one is looking forward to a holiday at a date some weeks ahead. Providence may favour the expectant angler with a good day, and the water in order but experience has taught most of us that the good days are in the minority, and that, as is the case with our rapid running streams, -such as many of our northern streams are, -the water is either too large or too small, unless, as previously remarked, you live near at hand, and can catch it at its best. A common belief in regard to loch-fishing is, that the tyro and the experienced angler have nearly the same chance in fishing, -the one from the stern and the other from the bow of the same boat. Of all the absurd beliefs as to loch-fishing, this is one of the most absurd. Try it. Give the tyro either end of the boat he likes give him a cast of ally flies he may fancy, or even a cast similar to those which a crack may be using and if he catches one for every three the other has, he may consider himself very lucky. Of course there are lochs where the fish are not abundant, and a beginner may come across as many as an older fisher but we speak of lochs where there are fish to be caught, and where each has a fair chance. Again, it is said that the boatman has as much to do with catching trout in a loch as the angler. Well, we dont deny that. In an untried loch it is necessary to have the guidance of a good boatman but the same argument holds good as to stream-fishing...",['Dumas Malone'],Warren Press,2007-03,['Biography & Autobiography'],

Copper Plate Photogravure: Demystifying the Process,"Copper Plate Photogravure describes in comprehensive detail the technique of traditional copper plate photogravure as would be practiced by visual artists using normally available facilities and materials. Attention is paid to step-by-step guidance through the many stages of the process. A detailed manual of technique, Copper Plate Photogravure also offers the history of the medium and reference to past alternative methods of practice. Copper Plate Photogravure: Demystifying the Process is part of the current revitalization of one of the most satisfyingly beautiful image-making processes. The range of ink color and paper quality possibilities is endless. The potential for handwork and alteration of the copper plate provides yet another realm of expressive variation. The subject matter and the treatment are as variable and broad as photography itself. This book's purpose is to demystify and clarify what is a complex but altogether ""do-able"" photomechanical process using currently available materials. With Copper Plate Photogravure, you will learn how to: · produce a full-scale film positive from a photographic negative · sensitize the gravure tissue to prepare it for exposure to the positive · prepare the plate and develop the gelatin resist prior to etching · prepare the various strengths of etching solutions and etch the plate to achieve a full tonal scale · rework the plate using printmaking tools to correct flaws or to adjust the image for aesthetic reasons · use the appropriate printing inks, ink additives, quality papers, and printshop equipment to produce a high quality print A historical survey and appendices of detailed technical information, charts, and tables are included, as well as a list of suppliers and sources for the materials required, some of which are highly specialized. A comprehensive glossary introduces the non-photographer or non-printmaker to many of the terms particular to those fields and associated with this process.","['David Morrish', 'Marlene MacCallum']",CRC Press,2003-04-03,['Photography'],

The Gnashing of Teeth,"A young American infantryman finds himself in a Korean troop train hurrying north to the front early in 1953. Thus begins a story of humor, pathos, horror, bitterness, and a chilling look at the class discrimination–whether intended or accidental–that created a warrior class of poor, uneducated men to fight a vicious enemy in a forlorn, inhospitable country. Later, this soldier’s epiphany comes from the lips of one of his beloved comrades, and creates the metaphor for much of the harrowing journey that is The Gnashing of Teeth. You will be witness to his growth, agonizing choices and painful search for redemption where little was forthcoming. Love also finds its way into this novel, beginning and ending in unlikely and sometimes heart-rending circumstances. Whether or not this soldier survives his journey is a growing concern readers will not satisfy until the very last words of this epic.

Strapped to horses and donkeys, Francis and others were taken north into lives of slavery under wealthy Muslim farmers. For ten years, Francis lived in a shed near the goats and cattle that were his responsibility. After two failed attempts to flee--each bringing severe beatings and death threats--Francis finally escaped at age seventeen. He persevered through prison and refugee camps for three more years, winning the attention of United Nations officials who granted passage to America. Now a student and an antislavery activist, Francis Bok has made it his life mission to combat world slavery.

The Tiger Moth story,"The Tiger Moth is one of the major aviation success stories in the history of British aviation. Developed by Geoffrey de Havilland and flown for the first time on October 26 1931, the biplane became the most important elementary trainer used by Commonwealth forces. More than 1,000 Tiger Moths were delivered before WWII, and subsequently around 4,000 were built in the UK with an extra 2,000 being manufactured in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Following the end of WWII, pilots could buy and modify a Tiger Moth for recreational use or agricultural crop spraying and use it relatively cheaply. This, combined with its popularity within the aero club movement, provided employment for the Tiger Moths until the late fifties when the more modern closed cockpit aircraft began to force them into retirement. This new paperback edition provides a comprehensive account of the aircraft origins and its development as a trainer of Commonwealth pilots in times of peace and war. It also looks at some of the other roles which this versatile little aeroplane performed such as a crop duster, glider tug, aerial advertiser, bomber, coastal patrol plane and aerial ambulance.

From Fear to Hope & Back Again,"This book is a series of reflections about the journey of mankind toward their God, whether they believe or not. It is dedicated to the struggle of all who live their lives with love for their neighbor and do the best they can with what they are given. It is further dedicated to those non-believers who live a life of goodness with real concern for their fellow man. We are all on a journey, whether we want to admit it or not. We only have so much time to accomplish what needs to be done. But in the end, only one thing matters. We are to be united with our loving God for all eternity. The bulk of the book concerns the promise that America holds for all people. In no way are the reflections intended to belittle any group that is true and honest in their efforts to help its followers achieve the goal of unity with God. The intention of the author is to provide some insight to the problems we face as a people. The problems are many, but first and foremost we must have the same interests for others that we have for ourselves. All of the problems we face have the same root. Thus far in our civilizations we have had much education and instruction. Much of this knowledge has lead to misunderstanding and has not addressed the root of our problems. The root is that we are not capable to love others as we love ourselves. If we do not address the root of the problem, then we will not be better off tomorrow than we are today or were yesterday. ‘NOTHING WILL CHANGE FOR THE BETTER’.",['Vicktor Barrios'],Author House,2012-01-18,['Religion'],

Anthology of American Folk Music,"Released in 1952, The Anthology of American Folk Music was the singular vision of the enigmatic artist, musicologist, and collector Harry Smith (1923–1991). A collection of eighty-four commercial recordings of American vernacular and folk music originally issued between 1927 and 1932, the Anthology featured an eclectic and idiosyncratic mixture of blues and hillbilly songs, ballads old and new, dance music, gospel, and numerous other performances less easy to classify. Where previous collections of folk music, both printed and recorded, had privileged field recordings and oral transmission, Smith purposefully shaped his collection from previously released commercial records, pointedly blurring established racial boundaries in his selection and organisation of performances. Indeed, more than just a ground-breaking collection of old recordings, the Anthology was itself a kind of performance on the part of its creator. Over the six decades of its existence, however, it has continued to exert considerable influence on generations of musicians, artists, and writers. It has been credited with inspiring the North American folk revival—""The Anthology was our bible"", asserted Dave Van Ronk in 1991, ""We all knew every word of every song on it""—and with profoundly influencing Bob Dylan. After its 1997 release on CD by Smithsonian Folkways, it came to be closely associated with the so-called Americana and Alt-Country movements of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Following its sixtieth birthday, and now available as a digital download and rereleased on vinyl, it is once again a prominent icon in numerous musical currents and popular culture more generally. This is the first book devoted to such a vital piece of the large and complex story of American music and its enduring value in American life. Reflecting the intrinsic interdisciplinarity of Smith’s original project, this collection contains a variety of new perspectives on all aspects of the Anthology.","['Ross Hair', 'Thomas Ruys Smith']",Routledge,2016-12-08,['Music'],

War of the Werewolf,"Militant extremists from opposite ends of the political spectrum have radical plans to change America, and they are not above taking innocent life to achieve their goals. But, each faction stands in the way of the other and each plans to eliminate the opposition. Mischievous fate, however, has dealt both factions a wild card and one of the leaders may have to commit suicide to stop an even greater evil from arising. The decision must be made before the coming eclipse of the Harvest Moon, unless Ludwig Von Dracula, claiming descent from his infamous namesake, can find a solution to stop the bloodshed. The action builds towards a twisting set of plot turns and shifting fortunes as various actors review their moral options and ethical obligations. A rollicking thriller that combines the traditional werewolf/vampire horror story with the political suspense novel, War of the Werewolf challenges the reader to rethink many cherished principles about right and wrong, good and evil. On the surface, it tells of the conflict between two violent radicals from opposite ends of the political spectrum. As the reader digs deeper, the story turns on decisions about making ethical choices involving life and death. How far will you go to stop a great evil from occurring? Would you willingly take innocent life to promote a socially just revolution? Would you sacrifice your own life for the greater good? Or, would you step aside and let matters take their natural course while you watch from a safe and distant vantage point? These are choices confronting several characters in the story. A fundamental question facing the reader is whom to root for and whom to despise. Who are the heroes and who are the villains? Where you stand on the political spectrum may effect your initial decisions, but as the story reveals more of the characters' actions and motives, you may find your allegiances fading or shifting. Major and secondary characters in this novel include: Alex Mallum, a left-wing radical, who believes that a right-wing media conspiracy distracts viewers from serious discussion of widespread social injustice. He had been married to Danielle Dante, the beautiful feminist writer. When she divorced him under humiliating circumstances, his life fell apart. On the run from the law and from a vicious California mobster, he stopped overnight at the Pentagram Pub, where sick with fever he believed he was attacked by a raging she-beast. Ever since that night he has suffered frequent blackouts and strange dreams about stalking wolves. Subsequently he went underground in New York where he fell in with CRUSH, a hapless band of wannabe urban terrorists seeking publicity through violence. When he learns that Danielle plans to marry Luke Fenris, the multimillionaire who symbolizes everything Mallum hates about America, he knows what CRUSH’s next mission will be. Then he learns what Fenris is really up to. Luke Fenris, a reclusive right-wing multi-millionaire who hates the Welfare State. Despite intensive journalistic investigation, his past remains a deep mystery. Although few know much about him, he has captured the public imagination as a can-do leader who many want to see run for President. He believes a left-wing media conspiracy wants to destroy individual freedom and turn America into a socialist state. Despite disappearing for weeks at a time, only to reappear for just a couple of days each month, he has brought together several influential co-conspirators to change the way America works. And that’s only the first stage of his plan. Ludwig Von Dracula, head of the Vampire Liberation Front and award-winning advertising copywriter, who has befriended Mallum.

"Robert Frost: Collected Poems, Prose, and Plays (Library of America)","Justly celebrated at home and abroad, Robert Frost is perhaps America’s greatest twentieth-century poet and a towering figure in American letters. From the publication of his first collections, A Boy’s Will (1913) and North of Boston (1914), Frost was recognized as a poet of unique power and formal skill, and the enduring significance of his work has been acknowledged by each subsequent generation. His poetry ranges from deceptively simply pastoral lyrics and genial, vernacular genre pieces to darker meditations, complex and ironic. Here, based on extensive research into his manuscripts and published work, is the first authoritative and truly comprehensive collection of his writings. Brought together for the first time in a Library of America single volume is all the major poetry, a generous selection of uncollected poems, all of Frost’s dramatic writing, and the most extensive gathering of his prose writings ever published, several of which are printed here for the first time. The core of this collection is the 1949 Complete Poems of Robert Frost, the last collection supervised by Frost himself. This version of the poems is free of unauthorized editorial changes introduced into subsequent editions. Also included is In the Clearing (1962), Frost’s final volume of poetry. Verse drawn from letters, articles, pamphlets, and journals makes up the largest selection of uncollected poems ever assembled, including nearly two dozen beautiful early works printed for the first time. Also gathered here are all the dramatic works: three plays and two verse masques. The unprecedented prose section includes more than three times as many items as any other collection available. It is rich and diverse, presenting many newly discovered or rediscovered pieces. Especially unusual items include Frost’s contribution to John F. Kennedy’s inauguration and two fascinating 1959 essays on “The Future of Man.” Several manuscript items are published here for the first time, including the essays “‘Caveat Poeta’” and “The Way There,” Frost’s remarks on being appointed poetry consultant to the Library of Congress in 1958, the preface to a proposed new edition of North of Boston, and many others. A selection of letters represents all of Frost’s important comments about prosody, poetics, style, and his theory of “sentence sounds.” LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation’s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America’s best and most significant writing.

The east in the light of the west: The children of Lucifer and the brothers of Christ,"‘A wonderfully beautiful legend tells us that when Lucifer fell from heaven to earth a precious stone fell from his crown… This precious stone is in a certain respect nothing else than the full power of the “I”.’ Seven years after staging Edward Schuré’s drama The Children of Lucifer, Rudolf Steiner felt able to talk openly about the complex relationship between the beings of Lucifer and Christ. In an extraordinary series of lectures, Steiner addresses the difficult and often misunderstood subject of Lucifer’s role in human development. Speaking within the broader context of ancient and modern – Eastern and Western – spiritual teachings, Steiner clarifies that Lucifer is not the simple caricature of evil that many imagine, but rather plays a pivotal role in human development. Whilst Rudolf Steiner held a deep respect for Eastern philosophy, he worked consistently from his personal knowledge of the Western – Christian – esoteric tradition. At a time when many of his colleagues revered ancient Eastern texts, Steiner viewed these same documents as representations of an earlier stage of human consciousness; as evidence of the heights that Eastern wisdom had reached, thousands of years before the development of Western science and culture. But Steiner maintains that the ancient truths need to be understood in the context of contemporary knowledge: that the old wisdom of the East has to be seen in the light of the West. Chapters include: Eternity and Time – Comparison of the Wisdom of East and West – The Nature of the Physical and the Astral Worlds – Evolutionary Stages – The Children of Lucifer and the Brothers of Christ – Lucifer and Christ – The Nature of the Luciferic Influence in History – The Bodhisattvas and the Christ.",['Rudolf Steiner'],Rudolf Steiner Press,2017-10-23,['Anthroposophy'],

"Salem Possessed, The Social Origins of Witchcraft","Tormented girls writhing in agony, stern judges meting out harsh verdicts, nineteen bodies swinging on Gallows Hill. The stark immediacy of what happened in 1692 has obscured the complex web of human passion which climaxed in the Salem witch trials From rich and varied sources—many neglected and unknown—Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum give us a picture of the people and events more intricate and more fascinating than any other in the massive literature. It is a story of powerful and deeply divided families and of a community determined to establish an independent identity—beset by restraints and opposition from without and factional conflicts from within—and a minister whose obsessions helped to bring this volatile mix to the flash point. Not simply a dramatic and isolated event, the Salem outbreak has wider implications for our understanding of developments central to the American experience: the disintegration of Puritanism, the pressures of land and population in New England towns, the problems besetting farmer and householder, the shifting role of the church, and the powerful impact of commercial capitalism.",['Paul Boyer'],Harvard University Press,1976-01-01,['History'],4.0

Ben Holladay: The Stagecoach King,"The red and black Concord stagecoaches that crossed the West in the 1860s, known to the Indians as ""fire boxes,"" have been celebrated in Mark Twain's fiction and JohnøFord's films. Predating the transcontinental railroads, they provided vital lines of communication to the East during the Civil War and opened to development the newly settled regions beyond the Missouri River. From 1862 to 1866 Ben Holladay owned and operated a network of stagecoach lines from Kansas to California, the main one following the central mail route between Atchison and Salt Lake City established by the U.S. government in 1848, and other lines branching into the mining country of California and Montana and Idaho territories. In spite of bad weather, primitive roads, holdups by highwaymen, and trouble with Indians, Holladay's coaches delivered passengers and mail on schedule. J. V. Frederick describes in fascinating detail the organization and operation of a vast transportation empire ruled by a man with executive genius and a gambler's instincts. Although Holladay forbade drinking and profanity on the job, he commanded the loyalty of his drivers, whom he dressed in broad-brimmed sombreros, corduroys trimmed with velvet, and high-heeled boots. He sold out just before the Union Pacific Railroad was completed and until his death in 1887 remained popular with Americans, who named racehorses and cigars after him.",['J. V.

Science of the Gods,"A paradigm-shifting blend of science, religion, and philosophy for agnostic, spiritual-but-not-religious, and scientifically minded readers Many people are fed up with the way traditional religion alienates them: too easily it can perpetuate conflict, vilify science, and undermine reason. Nancy Abrams, a philosopher of science, lawyer, and lifelong atheist, is among them. And yet, when she turned to the recovery community to face a personal struggle, she found that imagining a higher power gave her a new freedom. Intellectually, this was quite surprising. Meanwhile her husband, famed astrophysicist Joel Primack, was helping create a new theory of the universe based on dark matter and dark energy, and Abrams was collaborating with him on two books that put the new scientific picture into a social and political context. She wondered, “Could anything actually exist in this strange new universe that is worthy of the name ‘God?’” In A God That Could Be Real, Abrams explores a radically new way of thinking about God. She dismantles several common assumptions about God and shows why an omniscient, omnipotent God that created the universe and plans what happens is incompatible with science—but that this doesn’t preclude a God that can comfort and empower us. Moving away from traditional arguments for God, Abrams finds something worthy of the name “God” in the new science of emergence: just as a complex ant hill emerges from the collective behavior of individually clueless ants, and just as the global economy emerges from the interactions of billions of individuals’ choices, God, she argues, is an “emergent phenomenon” that arises from the staggering complexity of humanity’s collective aspirations and is in dialogue with every individual. This God did not create the universe—it created the meaning of the universe. It’s not universal—it’s planetary. It can’t change the world, but it helps us change the world. A God that could be real, Abrams shows us, is what humanity needs to inspire us to collectively cooperate to protect our warming planet and create a long-term civilization.",['Nancy Ellen Abrams'],Beacon Press,2015-03-10,['Religion'],13.0

"Classic American Popular Song: The Second Half-Century, 1950-2000","During the so-called ""Age of Melancholy,"" many writers invoked both traditional and new conceptualizations of the disease in order to account for various types of social turbulence, ranging from discontent and factionalism to civil war. Writing about melancholy became a way to explore both the causes and preventions of political disorder, on both specific and abstract levels. Thus, at one and the same moment, a writer could write about melancholy to discuss specific and ongoing political crises and to explore more generally the principles which generate political conflicts in the first place. In the course of developing a traditional discourse of melancholy of its own, English writers appropriated representations of the disease - often ineffectively - in order to account for the political turbulence during the civil war and Interregnum periods.","['David Jenness', 'Don Velsey']",,2006,['Music'],

The Shadow Of The Lion,"ADVENTURES IN AN OTHER-WORLDLY NEW-AGE VENICE it is the year 1537. The great winged Lion stares over a Venice where magic thrives. The rich Venetian Republic is a bastion of independence and tolerance. Perhaps for that reason, it is also corrupt, and rotten with intrigue. But for the young brothers Marco and Benito Valdosta, vagabond and thief, Venice is simply-home. They have no idea that they stand at the center of the city's coming struggle for its very life. They know nothing of the powerful forces moving in the background. They have barely heard of Chernobog, demonlord of the North, who is shifting his pawns to attack Venice in order to cut into the underbelly of the Holy Roman Empire. All Marco and Benito know is that they're hungry and in dangerous company: Katerina the smuggler, Caesare the sell-sword, Montagnard assassins, church inquisitors, militant Knights of the Holy Trinity, Dottore Marina the Strega mage . . . and Maria. Maria might be an honest canaler, but she had the hottest temper a boy could find. Yet among the dark waters of the canals lurk far worse dangers than a hot-tempered girl. Chernobog has set a monster loose to wreak havoc on the city. Magic, murder and evil are all at work to pull Venice down. Fanatical monks seek to root out true witchcraft with fire and sword. Steel-clad Teutonic knights, wealth traders, church dignitaries and great Princes fight and plot for control of the jewel of the Mediterranean. And somehow all of these, from thieves to mages to princes, must gather around Marco and his brother Benito, under the shadow of the great winged lion of Venice.

Sacred Beat: From the Heart of the Drum Circle,"The beat is universal -- drumming as a way of communicating with other people, spirits, and self exists around the world and throughout time. And contemporary drumming is thriving! In the neo-pagan community, the most popular festivals and workshops are those that feature drumming circles. In healing centers, nursing homes, women's centers, and schools across the country, people are forming drumming circles. Sacred Beat honors and explores every aspect of drumming -- historical, contemporary, practical. In Part I, Telesco and Waterhawk tell the history of drums and drumming circles and the myths, superstitions, and religions that have grown up around drumming. From West Africa to Tibet, from Siberia to England, from Vietnam to Apache territory, where Fox gave the people drums along with fire -- come stories about drums, their invention, their use up until contemporary times. People respond almost universally and profoundly to drums -- to relieve stress, to communicate, to move in rhythm with the universe, to praise their gods. A comprehensive section of practical information follows, with ideas for finding a drum and other rhythmic tools that are right for your vision, caring for and decorating your instrument, drum etiquette, and elements of a good drum circle. The next section of Sacred Beat is all about drumming in groups -- different ways it's being done, from Native American Pow-Wows to Goddess gatherings to community centers, and how to become a part of it. The book closes with a section on creating drumming magic all your own, with meditations, prayers, and divinations to create overall well-being and spiritual awareness with drums. The voice of the drum combines with the voice of the Ancestors, the voice of Spirit, and the voice of our own soul to create a powerful and transformational partnership. By working with the drum, a person can support this partnership, reach out to the community, touch the earth, and nurture their own spirit.","['Patricia Telesco', 'Don Waterhawk']",Red Wheel,2003-06-01,['Music'],
Francis Frith in Egypt and Palestine: A Victorian Photographer Abroad,"In 1856, the English photographer Francis Frith set out on the first of three tours of Egypt and the Holy Lands. Traveling up the Nile and then on to the Sinai, Palestine, Syria, and Lebanon, Frith systematically crafted exquisite pictures of ruins, landscapes, and legendary sites. He then published his views in England and America in a variety of formats, becoming something of a celebrity in photographic circles. This book, the first to place Frith's Egyptian and Levantine images in cultural context, reveals the distinct meanings these ostensibly ""topographic"" pictures held for the photographer and his Victorian audience. A Quaker by birth and an entrepreneur by nature, Frith brought to his photographic projects a sense of mission: to revive and confirm the stories of the Bible, while offering the region to armchair travelers as a seamless Oriental milieu of Romantic reverie. Francis Frith in Egypt and Palestine narrates the political, intellectual, and social concerns that make Frith representative of England's encounter with the East in the nineteenth century. Historian of photography Douglas R. Nickel brings a sophisticated interdisciplinary approach to bear on the subject in order to expose the complexity of Frith's image-making, setting the photographs against a Victorian backdrop of religious debate, imperialist thought, Romantic philosophy, and Pre-Raphaelite aesthetics.","['Douglas Robert Nickel', 'Francis Frith']",,2004-01,['Photography'],

Legends of the Iroquois (Myths and Legends),"THESE 24 Iroquois legends and stories have been told in the homes of the Iroquois for many centuries; long before the white man arrived on the North American continent. The perusal and study of these stories will, it is believed, give as much pleasure to the reader, as they have given the compiler. Of special interest is the “Legend of Hiawatha” made famous fifty years earlier by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Some of the stories and lengends in this volume are: The Birth of the Arbutus A Legend Of The River Legends Of The Corn The First Winter The Great Mosquito The Story Of Oniata The Legends of Hiawatha, and many, many more. The American Indians, like so many cultures, built neither monuments nor wrote books. However, they did make picture writings, known in later years as “wampum.” Mostly, these were mere symbols, recording mainly feats of arms. However, the Iroquois used wampum as a record of a person’s credentials or a certificate of authority. It was also used for official purposes and religious ceremonies, and it was used as a way to bind peace between tribes. Among the Iroquois, every chief and every clan mother has a certain string of wampum that serves as their certificate of office. When they pass on or are removed from their station, the string will then pass on to the new leader. Runners carrying messages during colonial times would present the wampum showing that they had the authority to carry the message. Wampum is still used to this day by the Iroquois in the ceremony of raising up a new chief and in the Iroquois Thanksgiving ceremonies. If the American forefathers had taken more interest in the peoples they found on the Western Continent, spending less of their energies in devising plans for cheating the Indians out of their furs and lands—a policy their descendants have closely followed and admirably succeeded in—our libraries might contain volumes of fairy tales that would delight the youth of many generations. =========== KEYWORDS/TAGS: Legends of the Iroquois, Aliquipiso, American Indian, american indian ancestry, American Indian books, American Indian childrens books, american indian east coast, american indian Iroquois, american Indian legends, american indian songs, american indian stories, american indian tales, american indian traditions, american indian tribes, american indian values, american indian warriors, american indian words, animals, Arbutus, arrows, Ash Tree, assemble, Authority, beads, bear, beautiful, beaver, bedtime stories, birds, Birth, brave, Buzzard's Covering, canoe, chief, children, childrens books, childrens stories, Confederation, corn, Cornplanter, council, council fire, dead, death, death song, eagle, earth spirits, evil, fables, fairy tales, First Winter, Flying Head, folklore, Folk-Lore, forest, fox, Gift, Great, Great Mosquito, happiness, Happy, Healing Waters, heart, Hiawatha, horse, Hunter, Hunting Grounds, Indians, Iroquois, Kanistagia, lakes, Legend of the River, legends, Legends of the Corn, lodge, lover, maiden, Manito, medicine, men, Message Bearers, Mirror in the Water, Mohawk, mountains, myths, Native American, Nekumonta, Oneida, Oniata, Onondagas, Origin, Orontadeka, panther, papoose, peace, Peacemaker, pipe, raccoon, river, sachem, sacred, Sacred Stone, Sacrifice, Seneca, Shanewis, Spirit, stories, streams, summer, sun, Tiogaughwa, trail, trees, Turtle Clan, Unwelcome Visitor, village, Violet, wampum, warriors, waters, white men, Why Animals do not Talk, wigwam, wild, wisdom, Wise Sachem, wolf, woods, young people",['Anon E.

Robert Pinsky, former poet laureate of the United States, plumbs the depths of David’s life: his triumphs and his failures, his charm and his cruelty, his divine destiny and his human humiliations.

If these sentinels could talk, imagine the tales they would tell of ferocious Great Lakes storms taking their toll on vessels and people alike. In this fully updated edition of Wisconsin Lighthouses, Ken and Barb Wardius tell those tales, taking readers on an intimate tour of lighthouses on Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, and Lake Winnebago. Both delightful storytellers and accomplished photographers, the couple complement their engaging text with more than 100 stunning color photographs, along with dozens of archival photos, maps, documents, and artifacts. Detailed “how to get there” directions, up-to-the-minute status reports on each light, and sidebars on everything from lighthouse vocabulary to the often lonely lives of lightkeepers make this the definitive book on Wisconsin’s lighthouses.","['Ken Wardius', 'Barb Wardius']",Wisconsin Historical Society,2013-10-17,['History'],1.0

Crucial Confrontations,"The authors of the New York Times bestseller Crucial Conversations show you how to achieve personal, team, and organizational success by healing broken promises, resolving violated expectations, and influencing good behavior Discover skills to resolve touchy, controversial, and complex issues at work and at home--now available in this follow-up to the internationally popular Crucial Conversations. Behind the problems that routinely plague organizations and families, you'll find individuals who are either unwilling or unable to deal with failed promises. Others have broken rules, missed deadlines, failed to live up to commitments, or just plain behaved badly--and nobody steps up to the issue. Or they do, but do a lousy job and create a whole new set of problems. Accountability suffers and new problems spring up. New research demonstrates that these disappointments aren't just irritating, they're costly--sapping organizational performance by twenty to fifty percent and accounting for up to ninety percent of divorces. Crucial Confrontations teaches skills drawn from 10,000 hours of real-life observations to increase confidence in facing issues like: An employee speaks to you in an insulting tone that crosses the line between sarcasm and insubordination. Now what? Your boss just committed you to a deadline you know you can't meet--and not-so-subtly hinted he doesn't want to hear complaints about it. Your son walks through the door sporting colorful new body art that raises your blood pressure by forty points. Speak now, pay later. An accountant wonders how to step up to a client who is violating the law. Can you spell unemployment? Family members fret over how to tell granddad that he should no longer drive his car. This is going to get ugly. A nurse worries about what to say to an abusive physician. She quickly remembers ""how things work around here"" and decides not to say anything. Everyone knows how to run for cover, or if adequately provoked, step up to these confrontations in a way that causes a real ruckus. That we have down pat. Crucial Confrontations teaches you how to deal with violated expectations in a way that solves the problem at hand, and doesn't harm the relationship--and in fact, even strengthens it. Crucial Confrontations borrows from twenty years of research involving two groups. More than 25,000 people helped the authors identify those who were most influential during crucial confrontations. They spent 10,000 hours watching these people, documented what they saw, and then trained and tested with more than 300,000 people. Second, they measured the impact of crucial confrontations improvements on organizational and team performance--the results were immediate and sustainable: twenty to fifty percent improvements in measurable performance.","['Kerry Patterson', 'Joseph Grenny', 'Ron McMillan', 'Al Switzler']",McGraw Hill Professional,2004-08-26,['Business & Economics'],4.0

Charles Simic was born in 1938 in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and spent his childhood in a city bombed by the Nazis in 1941 and then by the Allies in 1944.

By Any Other Name,"Is that a weed? This question, asked by anyone who has ever gardened or mowed a lawn, does not have an easy answer. After all, a weed, as suburban mother and professional weed scientist Nancy Gift reminds readers, is simply a plant out of place. In A Weed by Any Other Name, Gift offers a personal, unapologetic defense of clovers, dandelions, plantains, and more, chronicling her experience with these ""enemy"" plants season by season. Rather than falling prey to pressures to achieve the perfect lawn and garden, Gift elucidates the many reasons to embrace an unconventional, weedy yard. She celebrates the spots of wildness that crop up in various corners of suburbia, redeeming many a plant's reputation by expounding on its positive qualities. She includes recipes for dandelion wine and garlic mustard pesto as well as sketches that show the natural beauty of flowers such as the morning glory, classified by the USDA as an invasive and noxious weed. Although she is an advocate of weeds, Gift admits that some plants do require eradication-she happily digs out multiflora rose and resorts to chemical warfare on poison ivy. But she also demonstrates that weeds often carry a message for us about the land and our treatment of it, if we are willing to listen.",['Nancy Gift'],Beacon Press,2009-05-01,['Gardening'],3.0
The interpretation of dreams,"“The interpretation of dreams is the via regia to a knowledge of the unconscious element in our physical life.”—Sigmund Freud Freud’s discovery that the dream is the means by which the unconscious can be explored is undoubtedly the most revolutionary step forward in the entire history of psychology. Dreams, according to his theory, represent the hidden fulfillment of our unconscious wishes. Through them the inhibitions are released and tensions relaxed. The ability to interpret these manifestations of conflict in the human psyche opened a vast new realm of investigation, particularly invaluable in the treatment of neuroses. By his pioneer investigations into the world of dreams, Sigmund Freud created a transformation in our generation’s thinking. The Interpretation of Dreams is offered here in the translation by Dr. A. A. Brill, who for almost forty years was the translator and standard-bearer of Freudian theories in America.",['Sigmund Freud'],Modern Library,2014-01-22,['Psychology'],375.0
Intergenerational Communication Across the Life Span (Routledge Communication Series),"Individuals of all ages interact with one another, and their interactions have significance throughout their lives. This distinctive volume acknowledges the importance of these interactions and provides a life-span developmental view of communication and aging, attempting to capture the many similarities and changes that occur in people's lives as they age. The authors move the study of intergenerational contact closer to the actual participants, examining what happens within intergenerational interactions and how people evaluate their intergenerational experiences. The volume concentrates on the micro-context of the intergenerational interaction and the cognitions, language, and relationship behaviors related to intergenerational communication across the life span. The volume employs the perspective that the understanding of human behavior across the life span is enhanced by studying communicative behavior in intergenerational interaction. The authors integrate research from multiple disciplines concerned with intergenerational communication, which is framed by several unique theoretical perspectives drawn from the communication discipline. As a resource for the study of intergenerational communication across the life span, this monograph offers important insights to scholars, students, and all who are involved in intergenerational communication.","['Angie Williams', 'Jon F.

My Horse and Other Stories (New American Fiction),"Stacey Levine's My Horse, her first collection of short tales, reads with such precisely turned sentences that it seems to have been written with a scalpel. The stories of My Horse range from otherworldly, opaque portraits to claustrophobic domestic studies. In the title story, the narrator has a small pet horse, whose loose skin gradually develops scabby rings and sores. With painful psycho-logic the story recounts the narrator's various and changing attitudes toward the pet, as the physical deterioration of the animal is reflected in the owner's shift from love to abuse. In ""The Hump,"" a woman finds a small growth on her body, which, while she waits for a doctor's appointment, quickly grows into a large hump that affects her entire system and her perceptions of reality. In ""Cakes,"" the narrator buys several cakes with the intention of eating them to become very ""Full."" But the sudden appearance of a dog and cat at the window so terribly upsets her that she cannot eat the cakes; as the animals remain at her window for days, she postpones her enjoyment, becoming in the end ""quite ill."" In story after story Levine returns to the impermeability of experience, of not knowing even our own bodies with any certainty. A blackened tooth or a Siamese twin become haunting metaphors for the unreasonable, unfathomable burden of existence that she conveys in wickedly enthralling prose.",['Stacey Levine'],Sun & Moon,1993,['Fiction'],

The Kings of Judah,"The book of Chronicles, the last book of the Hebrew Bible and a central historical book of the Christian Old Testament, has in recent decades gone from being “the Cinderella of biblical studies” to being one of the most researched books of the Bible. The anonymous author, often simply called “the Chronicler” by modern scholars, looks back at the old Israelite monarchy, before the Babylonian Exile, from his vantage point in the post-exilic early Second Temple Period, and attempts to “update” the older historiographies of Samuel and Kings in order to elucidate their meaning to the people of his own time. In The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah, Yigal Levin does the same for the modern reader. He offers a brand-new translation and commentary on 2 Chronicles chapters 10-36, tracing the “sacred history” of the monarchy from the division of Solomon's kingdom to the final exile and return. Each chapter is translated from the original Hebrew into an English that is both faithful to the original and easy for the modern reader to follow. Extensive footnotes provide full explanations of the translator's choices and of linguistic and literary issues, taking note of alternative versions offered by a wide array of ancient and modern versions and translations. The comprehensive commentary on each section provides historical background and explains the text both on a literary and a historical level, making full use of the most up-to-date research on the text, literature, history, geography and on the archaeological background of the biblical world. The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah is to be followed by The Chronicles of David and Solomon on 1 Chronicles 10 – 2 Chronicles 9, and then by The Chronicles of All Israel on the genealogies of 1 Chronicles 1-9 and including comprehensive essays on the book of Chronicles, its time, purposes, methods and meanings.",['Yigal Levin'],Bloomsbury Publishing,2017-02-23,['Religion'],

One Man in His Time: The Memoirs of Serge Obolensky,"Few men lived lives larger than Serge Obolensky. Born to one of Imperial Russia's great aristocratic families, Serge had an idyllic childhood growing up at a time when his country seemed poised for an economic boom at the start of the 20th century. Coming of age at the start of the most destructive period in human history, he served as a cavalry officer on the Eastern Front of the First World War. Then, as his nation collapsed into Bolshevik tyranny, he chose to stay and fight as a guerilla for the doomed White Army. Eventually forced into exile, Serge rubbed shoulders with the elite of European society, wandering through the height of the Roaring Twenties and eventually landing in America. Swearing absolute loyalty to his newly adopted home, Obolensky embarked on a series of adventures in the world of high culture, finance, and industry, witnessing firsthand the growth of America from regional hegemon to global superpower. On the outbreak of the Second World War, Obolensky volunteered for the special forces. There he trained experimental units, developed advanced combined arms tactics, and eventually became the oldest man to complete parachute jump school. His extreme courage and skill led him to be selected for a series of seemingly-impossible assignments: first securing the peaceful capture of Sardinia with only a three-man team and later preventing the destruction of Paris's only electric power plant during the German retreat from France. All of these exploits and more are detailed in Obolensky's memoirs, One Man in His Time, now available at an affordable price for the first time in decades.",['Serge Obolensky'],Independently Published,2021-01-16,,
Mas Que Humano/More Than Human (Spanish Edition),"An ethnohistory on the spiritual and governmental conquest of the indigenous people in colonial Mexico, Idolatry and the Construction of the Spanish Empire examines the role played by the shifting concept of idolatry in the conquest of the Americas, as well as its relation to the subsequent construction of imperial power and hegemony. Contrasting readings of evangelization plays and chronicles from the Indies and legislation and literature produced in Spain, author Mina García Soormally places theoretical analysis of state formation in Colonial Latin America within the historical context. The conquest of America was presented, in its first instances, as a virtual extension of the Reconquista, which had taken place in Spain since 711, during which Spaniards fought to build an empire based in part on religious discrimination. The fight against the “heathens” (Moors and Jews) provided the experience and mindset to practice the repression of the other, making Spain a cultural laboratory that was transported across the Atlantic Ocean. Idolatry and the Construction of the Spanish Empire is a wide-ranging explication of religious orthodoxy and unorthodoxy during Spain’s medieval and early modern period as they relate to idolatry, with analysis of events that occurred on both sides of the Atlantic. The book contributes to the growing field of transatlantic studies and explores the redefinition that took place in Europe and in the colonies.",['Mina García Soormally'],University Press of Colorado,2019-01-21,['Social Science'],
Penthouse March 1991,"Hector Crawford – the name remains synonymous with Australian television. The tag line ‘This has been a Crawford Production’ still resonates with generations of Australians who grew up with his cops, the Sullivan family or any of the long line of productions that flowed from his legendary company. His public façade is part of our collective memory but the man behind it, and how his passion and determination changed Australian culture forever is revealed in ‘Hector’. In this compelling account of his life Rozzi Bazzani recounts vividly how, as Crawford’s influence grew, the off screen politics employed by the TV networks and rivals to diminish his company’s power became as exciting as any of his onscreen dramas. ROZZI BAZZANI was a successful singer and studio artist for many years before she turned to writing full time. In addition to spending years of her life researching Hector and Dorothy Crawford’s lives, she co-wrote the musicals Gershwin, The Musical and The King of Corn, and hosted countless radio and TV programs.

Color me healthy,"To combat the epidemic of weight gain, improve cardiovascular health, increase longevity while enhancing our quality of life, it is important to develop strategies that facilitate habitual physical activity. Preventing obesity in collaboration with communities, schools, work sites, and health care professionals is the key. Through the process of coloring and reading, the understanding of food and how our bodies form fats is further illuminated. We emphasize the role of exercise as a fundamental part of staying fit and healthy. The current consensus is that three core exercises are essential: aerobic, strength building, and flexibility training. It is undisputed that diet and exercise promote good health, productivity, and longevity. Now is the time to start. Meta-analysis, based on various types of exercise, have identified exercises that appear necessary for optimal health, especially for the increasing number of employees in sedentary, computer-based jobs. For example, simply try using “light movement,” about once per hour, to stimulate the lymphatic system and increase blood flow to the legs. Simply flex the toes and move your calves up and down. Then stand up and sit down without arm support, five to ten times, repeatedly. Follow up with deep breathing. Just ensure that the lungs are filled up completely. Then expand the stomach also to capacity. Let the air out normally and without pressure. To good health!",['Daniel Dolgin Ph.D'],Page Publishing Inc,2020-11-09,['Health & Fitness'],

"God, the Devil and Me","In this unique and highly entertaining autobiography, Alf Taylor chronicles his life growing up in the infamous New Norcia Mission, north of Perth in the fifties and sixties. At once darkly humorous and achingly tragic, God, The Devil and Me tells of the life and desperation of the young children forced into the care of the Spanish Nuns and Brothers who ran the Mission. Their lives made up of varying degrees of cruelty and punishments, these children were the 'little black devils' that God and religion forgot. Written with an acerbic and brutal wit, Alf intersperses dark childhood memories with a Monty Pythonesque retelling of the Bible, in which Peter is an alcoholic and Judas is a good guy. As a child, underfed, poorly clothed and missing his family, Alf sought refuge in the library in the company of Shakespeare and Michelangelo. He writes with joy about the camaraderie of the boys, their love of sport and their own company, but also notes that many descended into despair upon leaving. Most died early. Alf Taylor is one of the 'lucky ones'.",['Alf Taylor'],,2022,['Aboriginal Australians'],
The Perfect Portfolio,"How the greatest thinkers in finance changed the field and how their wisdom can help investors today Is there an ideal portfolio of investment assets, one that perfectly balances risk and reward? In Pursuit of the Perfect Portfolio examines this question by profiling and interviewing ten of the most prominent figures in the finance world—Jack Bogle, Charley Ellis, Gene Fama, Marty Liebowitz, Harry Markowitz, Bob Merton, Myron Scholes, Bill Sharpe, Bob Shiller, and Jeremy Siegel. We learn about the personal and intellectual journeys of these luminaries—which include six Nobel Laureates and a trailblazer in mutual funds—and their most innovative contributions. In the process, we come to understand how the science of modern investing came to be. Each of these finance greats discusses their idea of a perfect portfolio, offering invaluable insights to today’s investors. Inspiring such monikers as the Bond Guru, Wall Street’s Wisest Man, and the Wizard of Wharton, these pioneers of investment management provide candid perspectives, both expected and surprising, on a vast array of investment topics—effective diversification, passive versus active investment, security selection and market timing, foreign versus domestic investments, derivative securities, nontraditional assets, irrational investing, and so much more. While the perfect portfolio is ultimately a moving target based on individual age and stage in life, market conditions, and short- and long-term goals, the fundamental principles for success remain constant. Aimed at novice and professional investors alike, In Pursuit of the Perfect Portfolio is a compendium of financial wisdom that no market enthusiast will want to be without.","['Andrew W.

Walt Whitman: Selected Poems 1855-1892,"A fully unexpurgated collection that restores the sexual vitality and subversive flair suppressed by Whitman himself in later editions of Leaves of Grass. A century after his death, Whitman is still celebrated as America's greatest poet. In this startling new edition of his work, Whitman biographer Gary Schmidgall presents over 200 poems in their original pristine form, in the chronological order in which they were written, with Whitman's original punctuation. Included in this volume are facsimiles of Whitman's original manuscripts, contemporary - and generally blistering - reviews of Whitman's poetry (not surprisingly Henry James hated it), and early pre-Leaves of Grass poems that return us to the physical Whitman, rejoicing - sometimes graphically - in homoerotic love. Unlike the many other available editions, all drawn from the final authorized or ""deathbed"" Leaves of Grass, this collection focuses on the exuberant poems Whitman wrote during the creative and sexual prime of his life, roughly between l853 and l860. These poems are faithfully presented as Whitman first gave them to the world - fearless, explicit and uncompromised - before he transformed himself into America's respectable, mainstream Good Gray Poet through 30 years of revision, self-censorship and suppression. Whitman admitted that his later poetry lacked the ""ecstasy of statement"" of his early verse. Revealing that ecstasy for the first time, this edition makes possible a major reappraisal of our nation first great poet.",['Walt Whitman'],St. Martin's Press,2013-10-08,['Poetry'],4.0

The Gospel According to Allan Kardec,"In this book, Allan Kardec deals with a problem of great importance, especially taking into account the past and present relations between the Church and Spiritism. The Gospel according to Spiritism contains the explanation of the moral maxims of Christ, their concordance with Spiritism and their application to different cases of life. All the communications have been made by very high spirits, and texts due to different authors agree and integrate each other in an admirable way. It is the true interpretation of the life of Christ, his miracles, acts and parables, with an explanation and commentary of high spiritual entities, in a presentation that corrects errors and false interpretations to offer only and above all the truth. The name of Allan Kardec is famous in the world as the first codifier and therefore, practically, as the founder of the spiritualist doctrine, or rather, as he wanted to define it, of the spiritualist philosophy. It was his merit to have collected and coordinated in several volumes of great interest all the theories and principles enunciated, through various mediums, in numerous spiritist communications. At that time, spiritualism was in its infancy, and Kardec's works shed light on this new world that was opening up to man on Earth. After The Book of Spirits and The Book of Mediums, which are the foundations of spiritualism, appeared The Gospel according to Spiritism. Famous and spread all over the world, it will fully satisfy the demands and expectations of the numerous devotees and enthusiasts. Since it was written, the work has lost nothing of its topicality and validity, proving that the truth is always the same and its inspiring principles never change.",['Allan Kardec'],David De Angelis,2021-09-08,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']",

Raymond Chandler: Later Novels and Other Writings: The Lady in the Lake / The Little Sister / The Long Goodbye / Playback /Double Indemnity / Selected Essays and Letters (Library of America),"Later Novels and Other Writings begins with The Lady in the Lake (1943). Written during the war, the story takes Marlowe out of the seamy L.A. streets to the deceptive tranquility of the surrounding mountains, as the search for a businessman's missing wife expands into an elegy of loneliness and loss. The darker tone typical of Chandler's later fiction is evident in The Little Sister (1949), in which an ambitious starlet, a blackmailer, and a seemingly naive young woman from Manhattan, Kansas, are the key players in a plot that provides fuel for a bitter indictment of Hollywood and Chandler's most savage portrayal of his adopted city. The Long Goodbye (1953), his most ambitious and self-revealing novel, uncovers a more anguished resonance in the Marlowe character, in a plot that hinges on the betrayal of friendship and the compromises of middle age. Playback (1958), written originally as a screenplay, is Chandler's seventh and last novel. A special feature of this volume is Chandler's long-unavailable screenplay for the film noir classic Double Indemnity (1944), adapted from James M. Cain's novel. Supplementing the volume, and providing a more personal glimpse of Chandler's personality, are a selection of essays - including ""The Simple Art of Murder,"" in which Chandler muses on his pulp roots and on the special qualities of his hero and style - and eleven letters that range wittily and often sardonically over the worlds of writing, publishing, and filmmaking.",['Raymond Chandler'],,1995,"['Detective and mystery stories, American']",3.0
"Yoruba Ritual: Performers, Play, Agency","Yoruba peoples of southwestern Nigeria conceive of rituals as journeys -- sometimes actual, sometimes virtual. Performed as a parade or a procession, a pilgrimage, a masking display, or possession trance, the journey evokes the reflexive, progressive, transformative experience of ritual participation. Yoruba Ritual is an original and provocative study of these practices. Using a performance paradigm, Margaret Thompson Drewal forges a new theoretical and methodological approach to the study of ritual that is thoroughly grounded in close analysis of the thoughts and actions of the participants. Challenging traditional notions of ritual as rigid, stereotypic, and invariant, Drewal reveals ritual to be progressive, transformative, generative, and reflexive and replete with simultaneity, multifocality, contingency, indeterminacy, and intertextuality. Throughout the book prominence is given to the intentionality of actors as knowledgeable agents who transform ritual itself through play and improvisation. Integral to the narrative are interpolations about performances and their meanings by Kolawole Ositola, a scholar of Yoruba oral tradition, ritual practitioner, diviner, and master performer. Rich descriptions of rituals relating to birth, death, reincarnation, divination, and constructions of gender are rendered all the more vivid by a generous selection of field photos of actual performances.",['Margaret Thompson Drewal'],Indiana University Press,1992-03-22,['History'],

Dispatches from the Front: Theological Engagements with the Secular,"God knows it is hard to make God boring, Stanley Hauerwas writes, but American Christians, aided and abetted by theologians, have accomplished that feat. Whatever might be said about Hauerwas—and there is plenty—no one has ever accused him of being boring, and in this book he delivers another jolt to all those who think that Christian theology is a matter of indifference to our secular society. At once Christian theology and social criticism, this book aims to show that the two cannot be separated. In this spirit, Hauerwas mounts a forceful attack on current sentimentalities about the significance of democracy, the importance of the family, and compassion, which appears here as a literally fatal virtue. In this time of the decline of religious knowledge, when knowing a little about a religion tends to do more harm than good, Hauerwas offers direction to those who would make Christian discourse both useful and truthful. Animated by a deep commitment, his essays exhibit the difference that Christian theology can make in the shaping of lives and the world.",['Stanley Hauerwas'],Duke University Press,1995,['Religion'],1.0

Quantitative Analysis of Movement: Measuring and Modeling Population Redistribution in Animals and Plants,"In the last two decades it has become increasingly clear that the spatial dimension is a critically important aspect of ecological dynamics. Ecologists are currently investing an enormous amount of effort in quantifying movement patterns of organisms. Connecting these data to general issues in metapopulation biology and landscape ecology, as well as to applied questions in conservation and natural resource management, however, has proved to be a non-trivial task. This book presents a systematic exposition of quantitative methods for analyzing and modeling movements of organisms in the field. Quantitative Analysis of Movement is intended for graduate students and researchers interested in spatial ecology, including applications to conservation, pest control, and fisheries. Models are a key ingredient in the analytical approaches developed in the book; however, the primary focus is not on mathematical methods, but on connections between models and data. The methodological approaches discussed in the book will be useful to ecologists working with all taxonomic groups. Case studies have been selected from a wide variety of organisms, including plants (seed dispersal, spatial spread of clonal plants), insects, and vertebrates (primarily, fish, birds, and mammals).",['Peter Turchin'],Sinauer Associates Incorporated,1998-01-01,['Science'],

The Urban School: A Factory for Failure,"Americans worry continually about their schools with frequent discussions of the ""crisis"" in American education, of the ""failures"" of the public school systems, and of the inability of schools to meet the current challenges of contemporary life. Such concerns date back at least to the nineteenth century. A thread that weaves its way through the critiques of American elementary and secondary schools is that the educational system is not serving its children well, that more should be done to enhance achievement and higher performance. These critiques first began when the United States was industrializing and were later amplified when the Soviets and Japan were thought to be grinding down the competitive position of America. At the start of the twenty-first century, as we discuss globalization and maintaining our leadership position in the world economy, they are being heard again. The Urban School: A Factory for Failure challenges these assumptions about American education. Indeed, a basic premise of the book is that the American school system is working quite well-doing exactly what is expected of it. To wit, that the schools in the United States affirm, reflect, and reinforce the social inequalities that exist in the social structures of the society. Stated differently, the schools are not great engines for equalizing the existing social inequalities. Rather, they work to reinforce the social class differences that we have had in the past and continue to have in more pronounced ways at present. Rist uses both sociological and anthropological methods to examine life in one segregated African-American school in the mid-western United States. A classroom of some thirty children were followed from their first day of kindergarten through the second grade. Detailed accounts of the day-by-day process of sorting, stratifying, and separating the children by social class backgrounds demonstrates the means of ensuring that both the poor and middle-class students soon learned their appropriate place in the social hierarchy of the school. Instructional time, discipline, and teacher attention all varied by social class of the students, with those at the bottom of the ladder consistently receiving few positive rewards and many negative sanctions. When The Urban School was first published in 1973, the National School Boards Association called it one of the ten most influential books on American education for the year. It remains essential reading for educators, sociologists, and economists.",['Christian Karner'],Routledge,2017-09-29,['Education'],

"Developing Your Sixth Sense (Master Your Awareness for Greater Clarity, wisdom, and Power)","Most of us go through life experiencing only the material world, using our five physical senses - and not to their full potential, at that. But on rare occasions, we will catch a glimpse of the hidden, mysterious aspect of our existence, a flash of insight or inspiration received through the sixth sense. What we call ""the sixth sense"" is a natural, intuitive state of higher consciousness and spiritual awareness, a special power of inner knowing and psychic ability. Everyone has it, although it lies dormant in most people. But if nurtured and developed - a process easier than one might think - the sixth sense can be awakened, honed, and used to achieve greater joy and understanding in every aspect of your life, from your relationships to your financial affairs. In Developing Your Sixth Sense, world-renowned author and lecturer Stuart Wilde will show you practical ways to tap into this profound ability to improve the quality of your life's journey. You will learn: Seven levels of supersensory communication. How to win people over and discover the real meanings behind their words. How to control your etheric body. An action plan for creating your own luck. How to be a powerhouse of creativity. Energy patterns for loving relationships. The ESP of easy money. A system for recognizing ""types"" of people and avoiding the demands they can place on you. How to open and energize your chakras for healing. Why it's important not to interfere.

The Grounds of English Literature,"The centuries just after the Norman Conquest are the forgotten period of English literary history. In fact, the years 1066-1300 witnessed an unparalleled ingenuity in the creation of written forms, for this was a time when almost every writer was unaware of the existence of other English writing. In a series of detailed readings of the more important early Middle English works, Cannon shows how the many and varied texts of the period laid the foundations for the project of English literature. This richness is for the first time given credit in these readings by means of an innovative theory of literary form that accepts every written shape as itself a unique contribution to the history of ideas. This theory also suggests that the impoverished understanding of literature we now commonly employ is itself a legacy of this early period, an attribute of the single form we have learned to call 'romance'. A number of reading methods have lately taught us to be more generous in our understandings of what literature might be, but this book shows us that the very variety we now strive to embrace anew actually formed the grounds of English literature-a richness we only lost when we forgot how to recognize it.",['Christopher Cannon'],OUP Oxford,2004-12-09,['Literary Criticism'],

Three Great Novels of World War II,"A SLOW MOVING TARGET, The LSTs Of World War II, is a historical novel that contains many authentic stories about the turmoil and hardships that the Amphibious Fleet endured during beach invasions in World War II. To enhance the military adversities, the story revolves around the personal lives of five young fictitious sailors who, in 1942, enlisted in the U.S. Navy to defend their country against the Axis. They come from different parts of America and meet in the same boot-camp at Bainbridge, Maryland. As a result of the difficulties they encounter in boot-camp and in the war they become life-long buddies. After boot-camp was completed they were transferred to the dreaded and perilous Amphibious fleet of LSTs (Landing Ship Tank), because the LST is truly a A Slow Moving Target having the reputation of a brief life during an invasion. In this historical novel each principle character in the book presents his own unique and unusual experiences. The main character of the novel is John Maroni, who attempts to keep the group together and to preserve their friendship throughout the war. They call themselves The Five Phibies. The Five Phibies are later split-up and are transferred to different LSTs which compelled them to fight in separate campaigns in both the Pacific and Atlantic theaters. They continued to communicate with one another via one central location in the States. They send their mail to John Maroni's kid sister, Angela, in Queens, New York, who rewrites the letters by relating their war experiences, their health, and anything new about their personal lives, but deliberately leaving out any unpleasant ordeals, then sending the letters on to the Phibies. Phibie No. 1 is John Maroni who was born in Queens, New York. Phibie No. 2 is Dan Bletcher born in Dover, New Jersey. Phibie No. 3 is Andre Robbier born in Chicago, Illinois. Phibie No. 4 is Rich Hienman born in Dallas, Texas. Phibie No. 5 is Bob Olsen born in Boston, Massachusetts. Understandably, most historical World War II novels are written around large fighting vessels such as aircraft carriers, battle ships, cruisers, destroyers, and submarines. Very little is written about the LST and their amphibious operations on beach landings of unloading troops and cargo because it isn't a glamorized fighting ship. The book provides many authentic LST battles which are depicted through the fictional characters presented in this novel. The author tried to encompass the five Phibies in several authentic battles even though their characters and experiences were created by his own imagination. The LST played a very important role in the military operations in the islands in the Pacific, and during the invasions of France, Italy, and Africa. Without the LST and its ramp, the delivery of cargo to the beaches during an assault would have been extremely difficult and time consuming. The LST was not the most elegant looking ship to come out of American shipyards but it was designed for a purpose, to deliver men and cargo to an invading beach as quickly as possible, and to support the Allied troops ashore with ammunition, tanks, jeeps, trucks, artillery, medical supplies, and most critical of all food and water. Without these back-up goods the war may have been extended a year or more which would have cost many more American lives. The LST and the other Amphibious forces must be recognized for their part in the war by being one of the most essential components of World War II, and should be commended for their effort in the invasion of hostile enemies both in the Pacific and in the Atlantic theaters. This author attempts to do just that. The novel does not cover the land struggle after an invasion because the ground assaults have already been covered by other authors, and to repeat them here would serve no other purpose but to reiterate their achievements.",['Joseph Panicello'],AuthorHouse,2002-02-19,['Fiction'],

The Science of Consciousness,"This book explains in layperson's terms a new approach to studying consciousness based on a partnership between neuroscientists and complexity scientists. The author, a physicist turned neuroscientist, outlines essential features of this partnership. The new science goes well beyond traditional cognitive science and simple neural networks, which are often the focus in artificial intelligence research. It involves many fields including neuroscience, artificial intelligence, physics, cognitive science, and psychiatry. What causes autism, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease? How does our unconscious influence our actions? As the author shows, these important questions can be viewed in a new light when neuroscientists and complexity scientists work together. This cross-disciplinary approach also offers fresh insights into the major unsolved challenge of our age: the origin of self-awareness. Do minds emerge from brains? Or is something more involved? Using human social networks as a metaphor, the author explains how brain behavior can be compared with the collective behavior of large-scale global systems. Emergent global systems that interact and form relationships with lower levels of organization and the surrounding environment provide useful models for complex brain functions. By blending lucid explanations with illuminating analogies, this book offers the general reader a window into the latest exciting developments in brain research.",['Paul L.

Enlightenment against Empire,"In the late eighteenth century, an array of European political thinkers attacked the very foundations of imperialism, arguing passionately that empire-building was not only unworkable, costly, and dangerous, but manifestly unjust. Enlightenment against Empire is the first book devoted to the anti-imperialist political philosophies of an age often regarded as affirming imperial ambitions. Sankar Muthu argues that thinkers such as Denis Diderot, Immanuel Kant, and Johann Gottfried Herder developed an understanding of humans as inherently cultural agents and therefore necessarily diverse. These thinkers rejected the conception of a culture-free ""natural man."" They held that moral judgments of superiority or inferiority could be made neither about entire peoples nor about many distinctive cultural institutions and practices. Muthu shows how such arguments enabled the era's anti-imperialists to defend the freedom of non-European peoples to order their own societies. In contrast to those who praise ""the Enlightenment"" as the triumph of a universal morality and critics who view it as an imperializing ideology that denigrated cultural pluralism, Muthu argues instead that eighteenth-century political thought included multiple Enlightenments. He reveals a distinctive and underappreciated strand of Enlightenment thinking that interweaves commitments to universal moral principles and incommensurable ways of life, and that links the concept of a shared human nature with the idea that humans are fundamentally diverse. Such an intellectual temperament, Muthu contends, can broaden our own perspectives about international justice and the relationship between human unity and diversity.",['Sankar Muthu'],Princeton University Press,2009-01-10,['Philosophy'],

But remnants from his travels and things found and earned along the way push the renegade army threatening Eternis to decimation. After saving the city from capture, Taj turns his aggression towards the city that let his father down; the same man that spent a lifetime serving it. He cast down the churches of all faiths, save those of Draconic origin. He allows the Draconic Order to remain prevalent in the city due to it being the dragons that come down to help him. After, he focuses his newfound aggression towards the Republic of New Magic, more specifically Marko Kane, the killer of King Gerear s eldest son. Taj tries to utilize what heart he has left to rekindle the romance between him and Destiny but an act he deems as betrayal is too much for him. With Destiny forcing him to stay out of it, he orders a newfound ally to execute the culprit.

But then the war begins to consume him and the things the Father Vampire left inside him begin to writhe in his chest once again. This proves to Taj he s not fully gone. But those powers prove useful in the fight against the New Threat. In the end, he ultimately decides to sail to the heart of the beast in hopes of either securing a truce or ending its life.

ISO 9000 ABC's: The Small Company Guide to Successful Registration,"ISO 9000 is increasingly impacting smaller companies as larger companies demand that their supplier base have a formal quality system. Companies with less than 500 employees often spend too much time trying to understand the standards, changing their current systems, and over documenting every aspect of their daily operations. Time is money, and since many smaller companies delegate the project to one individual - who already has a full time job -understanding the basics as quickly as possible is essential. With anything new there is required research and knowledge - this book shortens the learning curve by explaining the key points, possible pitfalls, costs, and requirements to achieving registration. The author walks you through the process step-by-step, supplying examples of required documentation, auditor questions, methods of compliance, and basic program suggestions. Included in the text are two quality manuals. The accompanying disk contains templates for these quality manuals, procedures, forms and documents that can be revised as needed. Each procedure gives you a clear overview of what is required and serves as a boilerplate for quick modification and procedure generation. The disk makes individualizing the ISO 9000 documentation to your company easy.

Phoenix In The Ashes.,"Phoenix from the Ashes is a comprehensive look at the state of the Catholic Church since the Second Vatican Council--one of a series of recurrent periods of moral and intellectual crisis to which it has succumbed in its history. A chapter on the Council describes in detail how Pope Paul VI diverted it by placing it under the exclusive control of European liberals. An equally close study is devoted to the liturgical ""reform"" entrusted by the same pope to a group of radicals whose work undermined the spiritual and devotional legacy of the faithful. The loss of orthodox teaching and the disorientation following upon these changes produced a grave crisis in both clergy and laity, but the movement of return to tradition visible today promises a revival of the full Catholic life of the Church. Catholic readers now have a complete and eminently accessible account of the last 50 years of momentous changes in the Church, right up to the pontificates of Benedict XVI and Francis I. ""This wide-ranging account of the self-destruction of the Roman Catholic Church and its identification of her only realistic route back to the land of the living simultaneously strikes a blow at history's two most prevalent temptations: rejection or twisting of evidence in the service of an ideological thesis, and honest dedication to intense research on subjects whose ultimate existential value the 'unbiased' historian somehow fears to reveal to his readers. Henry Sire courageously shuts no doors and stifles no evidence, employing a passionate and lively prose that leaves no doubt regarding his sense of the crucial moral and cultural importance of his topic.""--JOHN RAO, author of Black Legends and the Light of the World and Removing the Blindfold ""For Catholics feeling lost at sea as a result of the turbulent crisis tossing and flooding the Barque of Peter, Henry Sire's work identifies clear landmarks to steady our gaze. He situates the present disarray within the larger historical context of the Arian heresy and Protestant revolution, and points to the buoys of tradition--liturgical, doctrinal, and philosophical--as sure guides to our way out. Sire distills entire epochs of history, from the first centuries of the Church through the current pontificate, into a highly readable and thought-provoking story. In the course of his tale he exposes the radical progressivism of the Second Vatican Council and its after-effects as well as the tepid conservatism of the Reform of the Reform and the Hermeneutic of Continuity.""--BRIAN M. MCCALL, author of To Build the City of God ""Historian H.J.A. Sire has compiled a balanced assessment of the revolution in the Roman Catholic Church. His mastery of the material is complete. The book flows along easily and readers will finish it confident that they have a comprehensive understanding of the last 60 years in the Church.""--ROGER MCCAFFREY, President, Roman Catholic Books ""Thanks to Henry Sire's penetrating book, we have some profound answers to nagging questions. How did the West end up so quickly in a post-Christian age, when only decades ago one could still speak of a Christian culture? How did we go from the seemingly healthy Roman Catholic Church of the 1950s to the mass apostasy and grave scandals of recent years? As Sire shows, the antecedents go back quite far, in fact many centuries, but the possibility of healing and regeneration is not as remote as we think.""--STEPHEN KLIMCZUK-MASSION, Senior Adviser, Hildebrand Project H.J.A.

He Knew He Was Right (Worlds Classics),"Trollope is usually seen as a faithful mirror of Victorian England, both in providing intimate details of contemporary life and in endorsing the moral attitudes and certainties of the period. His powers of empathy make his characters convincing and knowable in an astonishing way. Yet the Victorians restricted women to the house and severely limited their rights and opportunities. Trollope and Women examens the conundrum of how a great novelist could both accept the conventional values of the time and yet be able to see and sympathise with the impossible situations in which Victorian women often found themselves. Margaret Markwick shows the individuality of Trollope's women: even conventional Angel in the House heroines, like Mary Lowther in The Vicar of Bullhampton, can surprise us at times. More tellingly, he cannot help giving some of his less angelic characters, such as the vivacious Lizzie Eustace in the Eustace Diamonds, his unwilling admiration. His range extends beyond simple romance to the realistic handling of marriages, both happy and unhappy, and to the treatment of bigamy and scandal. He shows men and women getting on together as well as fighting bitterly. Nor are Trollope's novels as devoid of sex as has often been thought.",['Margaret Markwick'],A&C Black,1997-01-01,['Literary Criticism'],

As the new teller of these tales Abu-Lughod draws on anthropological and feminist insights to construct a critical ethnography.

All three poets extensively employ and comment upon the effects of repetition, yet represent three distinct poetics, considerably removed from one another in stylistic and historical terms. At the same time, the three are engaged in a highly interesting relation to each other - a relation readers tend to explain in terms of repetition, by positing Whitman and Stevens as the two alternative 'beginnings' out of which Ashbery emerges. Krystyna Mazur analyses the work of the three poets to discern patterns that may operate across a relatively broad spectrum of examples, as well as to consider the variety of ways in which repetition can structure a poetic text.",['Krystyna Mazur'],Routledge,2006-06-02,['Literary Criticism'],
INFRARED DETECTORS & SYSTEMS,"Infrared Detectors and Systems offers a deep and detailed examination of the optical detection process and the electronics of mimicking the eye. It further explores recent research in new detector materials and the latest advances in optical detectors. This text covers the range of subjects necessary for the understanding of modern infrared-imaging systems at a level appropriate for seniors or first-year graduate students in physics or electrical engineering. The first six chapters focus on fundamental background issues of radiation detection, beginning with the basics of geometrical optics and finishing with a discussion of the figures of merit used for describing the signal-to-noise performance of a detector system. Other topics include radiometry and flux-transfer issues, basic radiation-detector mechanisms, and random-process mathematics. The book concludes with a close look at infrared detection systems and related issues. In the discussion of infrared search systems, the range equation is developed in terms of the optical and detector parameters of the system. A separate chapter is devoted to modulation transfer function, a spatial-frequency-domain description of image quality. The final chapter describes the design equations for thermal-imager systems in terms of noise-equivalent temperature difference and minimum resolvable temperature. Supported and clarified by 470 illustrations and accompanied by an extensive glossary of the nomenclature, this is an excellent text for graduate and senior level courses in radiometry and infrared detectors. It is also a valuable reference for practicing engineers involved in the use, design, analysis, and testing of infrared detector-based systems.","['E. L. Dereniak', 'G. D.

Black Box,"Black Box is het televisieprogramma waar heel Nederland voor thuisblijft. Zeven kinderen van tien tot zestien zitten opgesloten in een zwart huis vol camera's op de Pier in Scheveningen. Black Box duurt een maand, en dat is genoeg om geschiedenis te maken. Jamie is de jongste redactrice van het programma. Ze is zeventien, enthousiast, naïef en al snel stapelverliefd: op Rijn, de briljante regisseur. Zo verliefd, dat ze niet meer ziet dat Black Box volledig uit de hand loopt.

"Henry James: Complete Stories, 1892-1898 (Library of America)","This Library of America volume is one of five that make available for the first time in new, complete, and authoritative editions the astonishing abundance of invention and unwavering intensity of the aesthetic vision of Henry James as displayed in more than one hundred world-famous stories ranging from brief anecdotes to richly developed novellas. Equally adept at ironic comedy, muted tragedy, and supernatural fantasy, at lively social satire and nuanced portraiture, James in his shorter works explores a staggering variety of situations and emotions. Here are courtships and legacies; the worlds of literature, theater, and the popular press; the paradoxes of temperament and the constraints of custom; the clash of conscience and desire. Stylistically, the stories allowed James to experiment with tones and devices quite different from his novels—dramatic plot twists and surprise endings, swift pacing and ebullient humor. The brilliance of his technical command allowed him to transform the tiniest of suggestions—a fleetingly observed gesture, an anecdote dropped at a dinner party—into fiction remarkable for its lambent surfaces and intricate psychological counterpoint. The twenty-one stories in this volume represent James at the peak of his storytelling powers. Among them are “The Turn of the Screw,” one of his most popular works, and a terrifying exercise in psychological horror centering on the corruption of childhood innocence; “The Real Thing,” a playful consideration of the illusion of art and the paradoxes of authenticity; “The Figure in the Carpet,” “The Death of the Lion,” and “The Middle Years,” three very different expositions of the mysteries of authorship, embodying some of James’s most profound insights into the nature of his own art; “The Altar of the Dead,” a somber, ultimately wrenching meditation on the relation of the living to the dead; and “In the Cage,” an extended evocation of the inner life of a young woman trapped in a dehumanizing job at a postal-and-telegraph office. LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation’s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America’s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.","['Henry James', 'John Hollander']",Library of America,1996-01-01,['Fiction'],

On Beyond Euclid,"This curious little book is basically a hitchhiker's guide to Book I of Euclid's Elements. We travel through each of the forty-eight Propositions-more or less in order-and see how each one generalizes-or does not generalize-to hyperbolic and other non-Euclidean spaces. Few people seem to realize that Einstein's special theory of relativity is a model of hyperbolic geometry. The connection between Minkowski geometry and special relativity is well-known, while the connection between hyperbolic geometry and special relativity is, rather, known of. But this book makes the hyperbolic connection explicit; Poincare disks rather than the traditional Minkowski diagrams are used to illustrate concepts of special relativity. As we progress through Euclid's propositions, it becomes increasingly clear that every theorem in neutral and hyperbolic geometry can be translated into a true statement in special relativity.""",['Ben Jacobs'],,2006-02,['Mathematics'],

Finnegans Wake,"A daring work of experimental, Modernist genius, James Joyce's Finnegans Wake is one of the greatest literary achievements of the twentieth century, and the crowning glory of Joyce's life. The Penguin Modern Classics edition of includes an introduction by Seamus Deane 'riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs' Joyce's final work, Finnegan's Wake is his masterpiece of the night as Ulysses is of the day. Supreme linguistic virtuosity conjures up the dark underground worlds of sexuality and dream. Joyce undermines traditional storytelling and all official forms of English and confronts the different kinds of betrayal - cultural, political and sexual - that he saw at the heart of Irish history. Dazzlingly inventive, with passages of great lyrical beauty and humour, Finnegans Wake remains one of the most remarkable works of the twentieth century. James Joyce (1882-1941), the eldest of ten children, was born in Dublin, but exiled himself to Paris at twenty as a rebellion against his upbringing. He only returned to Ireland briefly from the continent but Dublin was at heart of his greatest works, Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. He lived in poverty until the last ten years of his life and was plagued by near blindness and the grief of his daughter's mental illness.

Wolters begins by defining the nature and scope of a worldview, distinguishing it from philosophy and theology. He then outlines a Reformed analysis of the three basic categories in human history -- creation, fall, and redemption -- arguing that while the fall reaches into every corner of the world, Christians are called to participate in Christ's redemption of all creation. This Twentieth Anniversary edition features a new concluding chapter, coauthored with Michael Goheen, that helpfully places the discussion of worldview in a broader narrative and missional context.

A new beginning,"This book is a postmodern analysis of Ronald Reagans 1984 film, A New Beginning, which marked the coming-of-age of the televisual political campaign film. The film was a landmark in the art of political filmmaking. Its thesis proclaimed a resurgence of American pride, patriotism, and prosperity under the leadership of Ronald Reagan. A New Beginning was unprecedented for a number of reasons: it replaced the traditional nominating speech for the candidate at the Republican National Convention; its form was a hybrid documentary and advertisement; it illustrated the use of televisual rebirth rhetoric to gain public support for a political ideology; and, most importantly, the masterful project documented a shift from verbal to visual rhetoric in American presidential campaigning. The author examines the film as a cultural text and as an effective political tool. Framing, ideology, myth, and visual cliché are analytic tools used to deconstruct the film; the method combines rhetorical theory with communication theory and semiotically-based theories of film and television. Morreale gives insight into the increasingly prevalent use of television to create a political reality.",['Joanne Morreale'],SUNY Press,1991-07-03,['Political Science'],

Ben Hogan's pro golf record is legendary. A four-time PGA Player of the Year, he celebrated sixty-three tournament wins and became known as a man of few words and fewer close friends. Most of what we know about Hogan has been based on myth and speculation. Until now. In the 1960s, though Hogan's competitive career was over, he kept the practice habits that made him famous and remade modern competitive golf. He hired seventeen-year-old Jody Vasquez to help. Each day, after driving to a remote part of the course at Shady Oaks Country Club, Hogan would spend hours hitting balls and Vasquez would retrieve them. There, and over the course of their twenty-year friendship, Hogan taught Jody the mechanics of his famous swing and shared his thoughts on playing, practicing, and course management—unknowingly revealing much about his character, values, and beliefs, and the events that shaped them. In Afternoons with Mr. Hogan, Jody Vasquez shares dozens of stories about Hogan, from the way he practiced, selected his clubs, and interacted with other star players to his little-known humor and generosity. Combining the gentle insight of Tom Kite's A Fairway to Heaven (which recalls Kite's golf education under Harvey Penick) with the sage perspective of Penick's own Little Red Book, Vasquez's tribute is funny, poignant, and full of advice for golfers of all levels.",['Jody Vasquez'],Penguin,2005-03-24,['Biography & Autobiography'],1.0
THE LOST ART OF DISCIPLE MAKING,"""Every believer in Jesus Christ deserves the opportunity of personal nurture and development."" says LeRoy Eims. But all too often the opportunity isn't there. We neglect the young Christian in our whirl of programs, church services, and fellowship groups. And we neglect to raise up workers and leaders who can disciple young believers into mature and fruitful Christians. In simple, practical, and biblical terms, LeRoy Eims revives the lost art of disciple making. He explains: - How the early church discipled new Christians - How to meet the basic needs of a growing Christian - How to spot and train potential workers - How to develop mature, godly leaders ""True growth takes time and tears and love and patience,"" Eims states. There is no instant maturity. This book examines the growth process in the life of a Christian and considers what nurture and guidance it takes to develop spiritually qualified workers in the church.",['LeRoy Eims'],Zondervan,2009-07-13,['Religion'],3.0

Colorful East Broad Top,"It is the last of its breed east of the Rockies and the oldest narrow gauge railroad in the nation. Built in the early 1870s, the East Broad Top hauled iron, coal, ore, minerals and passengers for over 83 years. The three-foot-gauge trackage twisted along a picturesque 32-mile route connecting Mount Union, Orbisonia and Robertsdale in remote and beautiful south-central Pennsylvania. The ""Eastie"" earned its keep until the end of regular operations in the autumn of 1956. With the closing of the last Rockhill Coal Company mine, the EBT quietly closed its doors. It had outlived hundreds of its slim gauge counterparts across the country. The EBT connected isolated communities with the mighty Pennsylvania Railroad in Mount Union. It was here that the ""narrow railroad"" interchanged with the ""Standard Railroad of the World,"" using unique three-rail trackage and its own engines equipped with dual couplers. When the EBT stopped hauling coal in the late 50s, it was not torn up. While waiting for scrap prices to rise, owner Nick Kovalchick and his family became interested in preserving the line. A group of Orbisonia citizens, who wanted to celebrate the settlement's bicentennial, approached the Kovalchick Salvage Company in 1960 about the possibility of reopening a portion of the line. EBT's Operating Vice President C. Roy Wilburn was still on the payroll and, after much hard work and hard cash, the EBT reopened on August 13, 1960 for tourist service over a short section of trackage that ran north out of Orbisonia. Now, the rest is history. The EBT is unique and colorful in many ways. No where else can steam locomotives be found operating over original tracks with their three-way stub switches positioned by Harp switchstands. The Orbisonia shop complex, built after the 1882 fire, is one of the most outstanding examples of steam-powered, beltdriven machinery in America. Along the old line, the rails and bridges are still in place, tunnels wait in empty silence, cars are scattered about the Mount Union yards, and a standard gauge switcher still waits in the old, two-stall enginehouse for the restoration of the entire railroad. The EBT stands today as it did yesterday, unique in the field of historic, authentic narrow gauge railroading in the East.",['Mallory Hope Ferrell'],Heimburger House Publishing Company,1995-08-01,['Transportation'],

ORDINARY JUSTICE.,"""A groundbreaking book . . . revealing the systemic, everyday problems in our courts that must be addressed if justice is truly to be served.""—Doris Kearns Goodwin Attorney and journalist Amy Bach spent eight years investigating the widespread courtroom failures that each day upend lives across America. What she found was an assembly-line approach to justice: a system that rewards mediocre advocacy, bypasses due process, and shortchanges both defendants and victims to keep the court calendar moving. Here is the public defender who pleads most of his clients guilty with scant knowledge about their circumstances; the judge who sets outrageous bail for negligible crimes; the prosecutor who habitually declines to pursue significant cases; the court that works together to achieve a wrongful conviction. Going beyond the usual explanations of bad apples and meager funding, Ordinary Injustice reveals a clubby legal culture of compromise, and shows the tragic consequences that result when communities mistake the rules that lawyers play by for the rule of law. It is time, Bach argues, to institute a new method of checks and balances that will make injustice visible—the first and necessary step to reform.",['Amy Bach'],Metropolitan Books,2010-08-03,['Political Science'],5.0

SIGNAL DETECTION & ESTIMATION,"Signal detection theory--as developed in electrical engineering and based on statistical decision theory--was first applied to human sensory discrimination 40 years ago. The theoretical intent was to provide a valid model of the discrimination process; the methodological intent was to provide reliable measures of discrimination acuity in specific sensory tasks. An analytic method of detection theory, called the relative operating characteristic (ROC), can isolate the effect of the placement of the decision criterion, which may be variable and idiosyncratic, so that a pure measure of intrinsic discrimination acuity is obtained. For the past 20 years, ROC analysis has also been used to measure the discrimination acuity or inherent accuracy of a broad range of practical diagnostic systems. It was widely adopted by methodologists in the field of information retrieval, is increasingly used in weather forecasting, and is the generally preferred method in clinical medicine, primarily in radiology. This book attends to both themes, ROC analysis in the psychology laboratory and in practical diagnostic settings, and to their essential unity. The focus of this book is on detection and recognition as fundamental tasks that underlie most complex behaviors. As defined here, they serve to distinguish between two alternative, confusable stimulus categories, which may be perceptual or cognitive categories in the psychology laboratory, or different states of the world in practical diagnostic tasks. This book on signal detection theory in psychology was written by one of the developers of the theory, who co-authored with D.M. Green the classic work published in this area in 1966 (reprinted in 1974 and 1988). This volume reviews the history of the theory in engineering, statistics, and psychology, leading to the separate measurement of the two independent factors in all discrimination tasks, discrimination acuity and decision criterion. It extends the previous book to show how in several areas of psychology--in vigilance and memory--what had been thought to be discrimination effects were, in reality, effects of a changing criterion. The book shows that data plotted in terms of the relative operating characteristic have essentially the same form across the wide range of discrimination tasks in psychology. It develops the implications of this ROC form for measures of discrimination acuity, pointing up the valid ones and identifying several common, but invalid, ones. The area under the binormal ROC is seen to be supported by the data; the popular measures d' and percent correct are not. An appendix describes the best, current programs for fitting ROCs and estimating their parameters, indices, and standard errors. The application of ROC analysis to diagnostic tasks is also described. Diagnostic accuracy in a wide range of tasks can be expressed in terms of the ROC area index. Choosing the appropriate decision criterion for a given diagnostic setting--rather than considering some single criterion to be natural and fixed--has a major impact on the efficacy of a diagnostic process or system. Illustrated here by separate chapters are diagnostic systems in radiology, information retrieval, aptitude testing, survey research, and environments in which imminent dangerous conditions must be detected. Data from weather forecasting, blood testing, and polygraph lie detection are also reported. One of these chapters describes a general approach to enhancing the accuracy of diagnostic systems.",['John A. Swets'],Psychology Press,2014-02-25,['Psychology'],

Fromm stresses Marx's humanist philosophy and challenges both contemporary Western ignorance of Marx and Soviet corruptions of his work.

The positive accomplishments of the astronauts are put in context of an increasingly negative domestic situation in the '60s and '70s, the Bay of Pigs, civil rights, assassinations, growing involvement in and dissension about Vietnam, the Watergate scandal, and Nixon's resignation.",['Patrick J.

Que Tal (Spanish Edition),"BESTSELLER #1 DEL NEW YORK TIMES Mark R. Levin, autor seis veces bestseller #1 del New York Times, estrella de Fox News y presentador de radio, regresa para explicar cómo aquellos peligros sobre los que nos advirtió hace una década finalmente han ocurrido…y lo que se debe hacer ahora para hacerlos retroceder. Mark R. Levin movilizó a los conservadores en 2009 con Libertad y tiranía, el cual brindó un marco filosófico, histórico y práctico para detener el ataque liberal contra los valores basados en la Constitución, que hizo su aparición durante los años de Obama. Ese libro hablaba de que estábamos parados frente al precipicio del ataque del progresismo a nuestras libertades, desde la economía hasta la atención médica, y desde el calentamiento global hasta la inmigración. Ahora, más de una década después, hemos ido más allá de ese precipicio…y estamos pagando el precio. En Marxismo norteamericano, Levin explica cómo hoy en día los elementos centrales de la ideología marxista se han generalizado en la sociedad y la cultura estadounidenses—desde nuestras instituciones educativas, la prensa y las corporaciones hasta Hollywood, el partido Demócrata y la presidencia de Biden—y cómo a menudo se la disfraza con rótulos engañosos como “progresismo,” “socialismo democrático,” “activismo social,” y “activismo comunitario”. Con su característico análisis incisivo, Levin se sumerge en la psicología y las tácticas de estos movimientos de masas, el extendido lavado de cerebro de estudiantes, los propósitos antiestadounidenses de la Teoría Crítica de la Raza y del Green New Deal y la escalada de represión y censura para silenciar a voces opositoras e imponer la conformidad. Levin expone a un gran número de instituciones, intelectuales, académicos y activistas que lideran esta revolución, y nos brinda algunas respuestas e ideas sobre cómo confrontarlos. Como escribe Levin: “La contrarrevolución a la Revolución norteamericana está en pleno vigor. Y ya no puede ser desestimada ni ignorada, porque está devorando a nuestra sociedad y a nuestra cultura, rondando en nuestras vidas cotidianas y omnipresente en nuestra política, en nuestras escuelas, en los medios y en la industria del entretenimiento”. Y, tal como hizo antes, Levin busca unir al pueblo estadounidense para que defienda su libertad.",['Mark R. Levin'],Simon and Schuster,2022-08-02,['Political Science'],
Bound by Love,"What does it mean to be bound by love? Sometimes, the bonds of love supply bliss, and sometimes they demand sacrifice. Sometimes, experiencing love saves people, and sometimes it kills them. Being bound by love often engenders moral responsibility; in other cases, it enslaves and imprisons the soul. American mythologies—especially those presented in film and television—perpetuate love as the central narrative of one’s life; the search for a connection forged by love permeates every facet of human existence, from our desire to be accepted, or our longing to be needed, to our fury at being rejected. Sometimes love is the stuff of happiness, fulfilling in every regard. But there are also times when love makes us do things we should not do; sometimes it turns us into people we do not want to become. The commonality between love that satisfies and love that destroys is the bond between people who open themselves to the vulnerability of love. Examination of the theme of familial bonds in film and television explores how the process of forming and maintaining those bonds complicates, revises, and reproduces ideas about love. The chapters in this book explore how the nature of bonds and familial responsibility inform a popular cultural dialogue about the changing nature of the American family over the past sixty years.",['Laura Mattoon D’Amore'],Cambridge Scholars Publishing,2011-05-25,['Performing Arts'],
First Knight: A Novelization,"King Arthur has never been hotter in this steamy, magical, modern-day adventure of witches, wizards, and Bunsen burners! As the Lord of Camelot, it is Arthur's responsibility to protect the witches, wizards, and knights in the castle. But one witch in particular gets under his skin like no other. Morgan never listens, is difficult to control, and impossible to keep off his mind. With pressure mounting for him to take a wife, he sets his sights on a suitable Lady of the Castle. Someone agreeable, demure, and sophisticated. Definitely not a hot-headed scientist who always insists on getting her own way. Once upon a time, Morgan’s powerful intellect was rivaled only by the strength of her magic. But now that her powers have been ripped away, she’s determined to follow her dream of joining a physics research team at the local university. Too bad Camelot is on lock down and the impossible leader of the Round Table is dead set on bringing back the dark ages where witches are concerned. Morgan refuses to bow to the outdated beliefs of her people—she’s a modern woman and won’t be ruled by a man, even if he is sexy and scruffy and good with his sword. When Arthur and Morgan are forced to reevaluate their feelings for one another, will they continue the fabled rivalry of their namesake ancestors? Or will this noble knight and liberated witch discover a happy ending to their age old story? First Knight is the first in a series of modern day retellings of the myths and lore of Camelot. If you like fierce knights who would lay down their lives for their brothers and lose their hearts for their women, then you’ll love the Knights of Caerleon.",['Ines Johnson'],Those Johnson Girls,2019-05-31,['Fiction'],
The biography of a grizzly,"First published more than a century ago, The Biography of a Grizzly recounts the life of a fictitious bear named Wahb who lived and died in the Greater Yellowstone region. This new edition combines Ernest Thompson Seton’s classic tale and original illustrations with historical and scientific context for Wahb’s story, providing a thorough understanding of the setting, cultural connections, biology, and ecology of Seton’s best-known book. By the time The Biography of a Grizzly was published in 1900, grizzly bears had been hunted out of much of their historical range in North America. The characterization of Wahb, along with Seton’s other anthropomorphic tales of American wildlife, helped to change public perceptions and promote conservation. As editors Jeremy M. Johnston and Charles R. Preston remind us, however, Seton’s approach to writing about animals put him at the center of the “Nature-Faker” controversy of the early twentieth century, when John Burroughs and Theodore Roosevelt, among others, denounced sentimental representations of wildlife. The editors address conservation scientists’ continuing concerns about inaccurate depictions of nature in popular culture. Despite its anthropomorphism, Seton’s paradoxical book imparts a good deal of insightful and accurate natural history, even as its exaggerations shaped early-twentieth-century public opinion on conservation in often counterproductive ways. By complicating Seton’s enthralling tale with scientific observations of grizzly behavior in the wild, Johnston and Preston evaluate the story’s accuracy and bring the story of Yellowstone grizzlies into the present day. Preserving the 1900 edition’s original design and illustrations, Wahb brings new understanding to an American classic, updating the book for current and future generations.",['Ernest Thompson Seton'],University of Oklahoma Press,2015-07-30,['Nature'],
